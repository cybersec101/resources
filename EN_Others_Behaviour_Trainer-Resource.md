## Background and Detail for Trainer

### 1 Harassment and bullying online

#### 1.1 In Brief

The	harmful	effects	of	online	bullying	makes	it	unacceptable	but	it	is	hard	to	identify.	Identifying
and	talking	about	bullying	can	be	the	first	step	towards	stopping	it.

#### 1.2 In Detail


- There	is	no	practical	difference	between	online	harassment	and	online/cyber	bullying.

	- The terms are often used interchangeably, although bullying is more frequently associated
with	school	or 	work	environments [Note 1](#note-1).



	- Cyber	bullying	can	be	defined	as	“willful	and	repeated	harm	inflicted	through	computers, cell 	phones,	and	other	electronic	devices.”


	- Criminal harassment is considered to be a repeated conduct that causes its target [Note 2](#note-2) to reasonably fear for their safety.







- It	is	impossible	to	know	exactly	how	much	cyberbullying	goes	on	among	teens,	but	it	is	likely
that	at	least	20-30%	of	youth	have	been victimized [Note 3](#note-3).




	- Be	careful	of 	the	idea	that	bullying	is	common	or	widespread.
		- This	idea	could	lead	to	people	believing	that	bullying	is	normal	and	therefore	“not
a	big	deal.”

	- One incident of any form of bullying is one too many.

	- The	bullying	acts	that	create	the	harm	are	various	and	difficult	to	classify	or 	identify	easily [Note 4](#note-4).




	- Repetition	might	be	the	most	important	and	easily	identifiable	element	of	bullying [Note 5](#note-5).




		- The	ongoing	nature	of	bullying	creates	a	situation	where	the	target	continually
worries	about	what	the	aggressor	will	do	next;	a	worry	that	in	itself	could	be	a cause of harm.


		- Being	targeted	over	and	over	again,	even	with	relatively	mild	forms	of
mistreatment,	eventually	takes	a	toll.


		- The	harm	caused	by	online	bullying	is	sometimes	not	obvious.	However,	it	is	much worse	than	simply	being	mistreated,	pushed,	or	generally	made	fun	of.


		- Bullying	has	never	been	acceptable	or	beneficial.


			- There is no truth in statements such as:


				- Boys	will	be	boys;

				- It’ll 	toughen	him/her	up;

				- It	 will	help	him/her	grow	a	backbone	so	s/he	can	handle	life;	and

				- If 	it	doesn’t	kill	you,	it’ll	make	you	stronger

			- These	phrases	are	often	used	to	minimize,	normalize	or	cope	with	hurtful behaviour	and	cyberbullying	after	it	occurs.

All	life	lessons	can	be	taught	better	and	more	humanely	in	 ways	other	than	by	enduring	bullying.



- What	makes	a	bully?

	- Cyberbullies may:


		- be	angry,	frustrated	or	otherwise	emotionally	distraught,	and	are	simply	acting	out using	the	technology	at	their	fingertips.

		- want	to	avenge	a	hurt	or	injury,	seek	justice	or	teach	a	lesson.

		- be	 victims	of	bullying	themselves.


		- be	unable	to	connect	their	online	behaviour	and	the	offline	consequences.

			- These	aggressors	are	sometimes	called	“inadvertent”	cyberbullies	because,
although	their	postings	were	intentional,	they	intended	no	harm.


		- not	necessarily	be	those	who	are	mean	to	others	in	real	life,	although	this	is	often the case.


- What	are	the	effects	on	the	victim?

	- They may express emotions such as anger, sadness, frustration, embarrassment, stress,
fright,	loneliness,	helplessness,	worry,	defencelessness	and	depression.

	- Depending	on	the	person	and	circumstance,	the	impact	of	anonymity,	lack	of	a	safe	haven, a constant stream of harmful messages, and embarrassment due to the potentially large audience can be especially strong.

	- They	may	internalize	the	hurt	and	consider	self-harm	or	suicide	.


- Responses

	- Making	the	technology	work	for	you.


		- Block	certain	people	from	contacting	you	online.

		- Change	passwords,	user	names	or	email	addresses.


		- Delete	anonymous	text	messages	without	reading	them.



	- Turning	away	from	technology.


		- This	is	an	unrealistic	and	ineffective	long-term	strategy.

			- Technology	is	everywhere	and	integrated	in	virtually	all 	aspects	of	life.

			- Communicating	electronically	has	become	the	primary	way 	that	teens	reach their	friends	even	surpassing	face-to-face	contact	in	some	instances.

			- Technology	is	an	important	social	and	educational	tool,	as	well	as	a	source	or peer support.

			- No	one	should	miss	out	on	the	benefits	technology	has	to	offer	because of bullying.

	- Learn	what	your	grand/children	are	doing	online.


		- Monitoring	and	content	filtering	software	might	be	an	option	for	young	children
but	could	be	counter	productive	with	older	children	and	young	adults.

			- Seek	more	age	specific	detailed	resources	from	[PREVnet](https://www.prevnet.ca/).


		- Work	with	them	to	better	understand	the	technology	they	are	using	and	its	privacy implications and settings.


		- Participate	in	these	environments	with	them,	such	as	watching	YouTube	videos together	or 	video	chatting	with	family	members.


		- Talk	with	family	about	acceptable	online	behaviour,	and	make	it	clear	that	it	is	safe
to discuss feelings of being harassed.

	- Be	aware	that	many	victims	are	unwilling	to	tell	adults	about	their	victimization.


		- Boys	and	older	victims	are	especially	unwilling.	If	they	do	tell	someone,	most would	tell	a	friend,	a	parent/guardian.	Some	would	tell	school	staff.


		- Few	actually	seek	help	from	others.	If	they	do	tell,	their	first	choice	is	a	friend,	then
a	parent	and	lastly	a	teacher.	Willingness	to	tell	school	staff	or 	a	parent	decreases
with	age.

	- There	are	good	resources	online	that	provide	more	specific	information,	advice	and	tools	to help	learn	about	and	deal	with	cyberbullying.


		- In	particular,	we	recommend	the	[PREVNet website](https://www.prevnet.ca/bullying/cyber-bullying),	a	Canadian	group	that	provides	excellent	resources

#### 1.3 In Practice

DO	take	online	harassment	and	bullying	seriously.

DO	be	aware	of	how	family	members	use	the	Internet.

DO	seek	information	if	you	are	concerned	about	someone	you	know.

#### 2 Predators exist online

#### 2.1 In Brief

Sexual	abuse	is	a	danger	online.	Younger	people	are	at	greater	risk	of	becoming	victims.

Being	aware	of	and	supportively	involved	in	their	use	of	the	Internet	can	provide	a	positive supervisory	influence.

#### 2.2 In Detail




- The	Internet	provides	an	avenue	for	predators to contact and	abuse	vulnerable	members	of society. This can result in the sexual abuse of young people.
	- Victims	may	be	persuaded	or	forced	to:
		- send	or	post	sexually	explicit	images of themselves;


		- take	part	in	sexual	activities	via	a	webcam	or	smartphone;


		- have	sexual	conversations	by	text	or	online [Note 6](#note-6).







		- physically	meet	with	abusers

	- The	effects	of	the	abuse	(for	example,	images	or	videos)	may	continue	to	circulate	online long after the sexual abuse has stopped.


		- This	makes	online	sexual	abuse	particularly	harmful,	as	the	torment	is	prolonged
far beyond the initial abuse.




- There	is	no	single	risk	factor	for 	abuse.

	- Rather,	there	is	a	complex	interplay	of 	multiple	risk	factors,	and	missing	protective	factors
that	can	decrease	a	young	person's	resilience,	making	them	vulnerable	to	abuse.

	- Adolescents	may	be	at	greater	risk	of	unwanted	sexual	solicitations	than	younger	children or adults.


		- Adolescents	are	naturally	inexperienced,	sensation-seeking,	impulsive	and risk-seeking.


		- This,	combined	with	a	tendency	to	explore	sexual	urges,	makes	them	likely	to	be particularly	vulnerable	online.


- Predators	build	relationships	with	children	over	time	and	in	many	ways.

	- The	amount	of	time	this	process	takes	varies	from	seconds	to	years.

	- The nature of the manipulation depends on many factors but it is common for the abuser
to	use	flattering	language	and	ask	about	parents,	their	schedules	and	sex	early	on	in
the relationship.


		- Offenders	may	use	flattery	to	make	the	young	person	feel	special,	exploiting	their
natural	need	to	feel	loved	and	cared	for.

			- The	person	may	not	feel	like	that	are	in	an	abusive	relationship	and	that	the offender	is	trustworthy.




		- Conversely,	an	offender	may	use	intimidation	and	fear	as	part	of	grooming, potentially	using	blackmail	as	a	means	of	control.

			- Abusers	may	threaten	to	send	images,	video	or	copies	of	conversations	to	the young	person's	friends	and	family	unless	they	take	part	in	sexual	activity.


		- These	means	are	designed	to	systematically	desensitize	and	psychologically prepare	the	victim	until	they	are	more	likely	to	engage	in	sexual	activity.


- A	parent's	involvement	and	monitoring	of	the	young	person's	Internet	use	can	be	a	protective
factor against abuse.

	- Young	people	whose	parents	oversee	their	Internet	use	have	fewer	negative	experiences
online than other young people.

	- A	young	person's	awareness	of	parental	Internet	monitoring	and	parental	involvement
with	Internet	as	well	as	a	supportive	relationship	with	parents	and	peers	can	reduce	the
likelihood	of	being	victimized	online.



- Victims	may	respond	to	abuse	in	many	ways.

	- They may try To cope through suppression and denial or by reframing the issue.

	- They	may	seek	solace	in	a	variety	of 	ways	including	social	support,	working	hard,	worrying,
wishful	thinking,	self-blame,	physical	recreation,	and	keeping	to	themselves.

	- Children	need	a	supportive	structure	to	reveal	their	experiences	of	sexual	abuse.


		- Children	who	suffer	severe	and	frequent	sexual	abuse	tend	to	disclose	belatedly,
hesitantly	and	indirectly,	or	are	afraid	or	shameful	of 	their	parents’	reactions.

			- Children	who	expect	negative	reactions	from	their	parents	delay	telling	them,
and also tend to tell people other than their parents.


			- Children	find	it	difficult	to	initiate	a	conversation	about	something	secret,
confusing	and	distressful	where	there	are	few	opportunities	in	a	family	for
talking	about	such	themes.

			- Children	are	sensitive	to	the	needs	of	their	caregivers	and	fear	consequences
for 	their	family	and	the	offender.




		- When	children	do	disclose,	they	do	so	in	situations	where	the	theme	of	child sexual	abuse	is	already	addressed	or	activated.

			- Some	children	feel	it	can	be	difficult	to	find	situations	containing	enough privacy	and	prompts	for	them	to	share	their	experiences.

			- Disclosure	becomes	easier	if 	a	child	perceives	that	there	is	an	opportunity
to	talk,	a	purpose	for	speaking,	and	a	connection	on	the	subject	has
been established.

- 	[Tools	and	resources	are	available](https://www.protectchildren.ca/app/en/)

#### 2.3 In Practice

DO	be	an	involved	in	your	child’s	Internet	use.

DO	set	boundaries	for	acceptable	behaviour.

DO	provide	a	supportive	environment	that	allows	them	to	talk	about	abuse

### 3 Online fraud

#### 3.1 In Brief

There	is	fraud	online.	Being	aware	of	common	scams	can	help	identify	and	avoid	harm.	You	can

Recognize,	Report	and	Stop	Fraud	online.

#### 3.2 In Detail




- The	ease	of	communications	on	the	Internet	allows	scammers	and	con	artists	to	reach	more people more easily.

- Some	of	their	scams	use	telephone	calls,	fake	websites,	email,	online	messaging	etc.	to	try	to convince	people	to	part	with	their	personal	information,	money	or 	the	information	of	others.


- It	is	important	to	be	wary	of 	scams,	and	to	take	your	time	and	think	critically	if 	you	suspect	a
person	is	trying	to	trick	you.


- Being	aware	of	common	scams	can	help	identify	cons,	but	there	are	many	other	types	of scams	and	variants	of	these	scams.

	- A Request for Money



	- Emergency	scams



		- Scammers	use	social	media,	the	Internet	and	newspapers	to	target	potential
senior	victims.

			- A call is made from somebody claiming to be a family member or a close
friend	advising	about	an	urgent	situation	that	requires	immediate	funds.
Common	themes	have	been	that	the	family	member	was	arrested	or	got	into
an	accident	while	travelling	abroad.	Fees	are	required	for	hospital	expenses,
lawyer	fees	or	bail.	Usually,	the	potential	victim	is	instructed	to	send	money
through	a	money	service	business	like	Western	Union	or	MoneyGram.




		- How	to	protect	yourself

			- Confirm	with	other	relatives	the	whereabouts	of	the	family	member	or 	friend.

			- Police,	judges	or	legal	entities	will	never	ask	you	to	send	money	through
money	service	businesses.Never	give	out	family	members’	names	or
information	to	unknown	callers.

			- Always	question	urgent	requests	for	money.


	- Romance scams




		- Romance	scams	involve	a	criminal	with	false	romantic	intensions	that	gain	the
affection	of	their	victim	to	gain	access	to	their	money


		- These	scams	have	a	profound	impact	on	consumers	and	cause	severe	financial
harm.	In	2014	alone,	Canadians	lost	$13	million	to	this	scam.

			- Fraudsters steal photos and use dating sites and social media to lure
potential	victims	into	sending	money	for 	various	reasons.

			- The	fraudsters	are	willing	to	develop	the	relationship	over	an	extended
period	of	time.	This	increases	the	trust	level	between	the	victim	and	the
fraudster	which	results	in	the	potential	victim	usually	losing	more	money.

			- The	fraudster	will	gain	the	trust	of	the	victim	through	displays	of	affection, and	will	sometimes	send	gifts,	flowers	and	tokens	to	prove	that	their	feelings
are	genuine.	While	the	fraudster	is	usually	in	another	country,	eventually	they
will	say 	that	they	want	to	meet	the	potential	victim	in	person	but	can’t	afford
to	travel	and	ask	the	victim	to	cover	the	cost.	Variations	include	the	fraudster
presenting	emergency	or 	urgent	situations,	such	as	a	sick	family	member,
and	seeking	financial	assistance	from	the	victim	for	various	costs.




		- How	to	protect	yourself

			- Be	on	the	lookout	for	someone	who	claims	to	be	from	Canada	or	the	US	but is	 working	overseas.

			- Be	careful	communicating	with	someone	who	claims	to	have	fallen	in	love with	you	quickly.


			- Beware	if	they	claim	they	are	coming	to	visit	you	but	some	situation	prevents it	from	happening;

			- If 	you	are	dating	online,	leave	the	dating	site;	the	person	will	usually	want	to use instant messaging or email.

			- Don't cash any cheques or send the person any money for any reason, whatsoever!




- A Company Suddenly Contacts you

	- Service	scams


		- **_Microsoft/Windows technician_**.

			- Scammers	pretend	to	represent	a	well-known	computer	company	like
Microsoft,	and	claim	that	the	victim’s	computer	is	sending	out	viruses	or	has been	hacked	and	must	be	cleaned.

			- The	scammer	will	gain	remote	access	to	the	computer	and	may	run	some
programs or change some settings.

			- The	scammer	will	then	advise	that	a	fee	is	due	for	the	cleaning	and	ask	for	a credit	card	number	to	cover	the	payment.

			- In	some	cases,	the	scammer	will	send	a	transfer	from	the	victim’s	computer through	a	money	service	business	like	Western	Union	or	MoneyGram.

			- The	result	is	that	the	victim	pays	for	a	service	that	was	not	needed	as	the computer	was	never	infected.




		- **_Lower Interest Rate_**.

			- Scammers	offer	to	reduce	interest	rates	on	the	victim’s	credit	cards	or	line of credit.

			- They	ask	for	personal	information	such	as	SIN,	mother’s	maiden	name,	date of 	birth	and	the	credit	card	number	with	the	expiry	date	of	the	cards	they want	reduced.

		- **_Utility Scams_**.

			- Scammers	claim	to	represent	the	local	electric,	water	or 	gas	company,
advising	that	there	is	an	overdue	bill	and	payment	is	required	immediately	or the	services	will	be	shut	off.

			- The	scammer	asks	for	payment	by	prepaid	debit	such	as	a	Green	Dot Card.	Prepaid	Debit	cards	are	not	the	same	as	a	bank	account.	No	photo
identification	is	required	and	the	cards	are	difficult	to	trace.


		- How	to	protect	yourself

			- Microsoft	or	any	other	large	computer	company	will	never	call you.

			- While utility companies do contact customers by phone from time to time,
they	will	never	request	a	payment	by	prepaid	debit	over	the	phone.	Overdue
payments	would	appear	on	 your	next	month’s	bill.

			- Call	the	customer	service	number	on	 your	utility	bill.	This	will	ensure	you	are
speaking	to	a	real	employee	of	the	real	company.

			- Never	give	out	personal	information	over	the	phone.

			- Don’t	be	afraid	to	ask	questions.

			- If 	you	feel	pressured,	never	hesitate	to	terminate	a	call.




- You	unexpectedly	win

	 - Prize	scam




		- Scammers	claim	to	represent	“Reader’s	Digest”	or 	“Set	For	Life	Lottery.”	Persons
are	told	they	have	won	a	prize,	and	have	to	provide	their	bank	debit	card	number,
date	of	birth	and	in	some	cases,	are	asked	to	enter	their	PIN	into	the	telephone
key 	pad,	in	order	to	collect	the	prize.


		- Scammers	target	people	who	do	not	use	online	banking	services,	and	use	the
financial	information	to	take	over	the	account,	which	is	then	used	to	launder	money
and	proceeds	from	other	mass-marketing	fraud	scams.


		- Prior	to	receiving	any	winnings,	the	consumer	must	first	pay	an	upfront	fee.	No winnings	are	ever	received.

	- Vacation	scams




		- Individuals	receive	a	cold	call	advising	that	they	have	won	a	vacation.	Real
company	names	such	as	Expedia,	Air	Miles,	Air	Canada	and	WestJet	have	been
used.	The	caller	advises	the	potential	victim	that	they	are	a	preferred	customer,
and	have	been	awarded	a	credit	or	discount	on	a	trip	if	booked	immediately.

		- High-pressure	sales	tactics	are	used,	and	the	caller	will	ask	for	a	credit	card
number to pay for fees such as taxes.




		- There	is	no	Vacation	or	Flight.




		- How	to	protect	yourself

			- Any 	unsolicited	phone	call	advising	that	you	have	won	a	lottery	is	fake.	The
only	way 	to	participate	in	any	foreign	lottery	is	to	go	to	the	country	of 	origin
and	purchase	a	ticket	in	person.	A	ticket	cannot	be	bought	on	your	behalf.

			- Known	lottery	and	sweepstakes	companies	such	as	Reader’s	Digest	and
Publisher’s	Clearinghouse	will	never	ask	for	money	up	front	before	sending a	prize.


			- Any 	fees	associated	with	winnings	will	never	be	paid	through	a	money	service
business	such	as	Western	Union,	MoneyGram	or	by 	loading	funds	to	prepaid
credit	cards	such	as	Green	Dot.If	an	unknown	caller	tells	you	that	you	won	a
contest	you	didn’t	enter,	hang	up.

			- If 	you	receive	a	call	advising	you	have	won	a	free	vacation	but	have	to	provide
a	credit	card	number	to	cover	taxes	before	going	on	the	vacation,	hang	up.

			- Check	the	website	of	legitimate	companies;	they	usually	post	warnings	about these types of solicitations.

			- Never	give	out	personal	information	or	credit	card	information	over the phone.

			- If 	it	seems	too	good	to	be	true...it	is.


- Buying and selling online

	- Buying online


		- Every	year	hot-ticket	items	like	gaming	systems	and	toys	sell	out	in	retail	stores. Scammers	will	set	up	web	sites	or	list	these	items	for	sale	on	classified	ads	and
auction	web	sites.	Consumers	pay	for 	the	item	but	never	receive	them.




		- Warning signs

			- An	item	being	sold	at	an	incredible	(almost	unbelievable)	price.
			- Very	low	in	price	compared	to	other	similar	items	being	sold.
			- Use	of	the	word	“item”	instead	of	what	it	is	that	you	are	buying	(very	generic conversation-	almost	sounds	cut-and-paste).
			- Spelling	mistakes	in	the	ad	or	communication.
			- Communication	done	only	via	email.




		- How	to	protect	yourself

			- Check	the	“feedback”	of 	the	seller	from	whom	you	want	to	buy.	Do	not	buy from	a	new	seller	or 	a	seller	with	negative	reviews.

			- Research	the	company:	verify	its	physical	address	and	phone	number.

			- Deal	with	companies	or	individuals	you	know	by 	reputation	or	from	past
experience.

			- Never	make	a	deal	outside	the	auction	site.

			- Read	the	terms	and	conditions;	understand	the	payment	options,	return
policy	and	product	warranty.


			- Verify	the	fraud	coverage	with	the	payment	method	you	use.	Using	an Internet	Payment	Service	or	paying	by	credit	card	is	often	the	most	secure.

			- If 	the	asking	price	of	a	product	is	too	good	to	be	true...	it	is.

	- Selling online




	- Sellers	need	to	be	aware	that	not	all	offers	to	purchase	are	honest	ones.

		- The	seller	usually	receives	a	reply	from	a	scammer	looking	to	buy	their	item.
The	scammer	will	transfer	fake	payment(s)	to	 the	 seller’s	account,	paying	with
a	stolen	credit	card	or	with	fraudulent	cheques.	In	some	situations,	the	victim
loses	the	item	and	money	due	to	overpayment	by	the	fraudster	or 	shipping
charges for the product.




	- Warning signs

		- Scammers	don’t	try	to	bargain	you	down,	and	may	even	pay	you	more	to
remove	add	from	website	immediately.

		- Scammers	overpay	and	ask	to	send	additional	funds	to	a	shipping	agent.

		- They	don’t	come	to	check	out	the	product;	they	don’t	hesitate	to	buy.

		- They	use	the	word	“item”	instead	of	what	the	item	is	that	you	are	selling	(very generic	conversation—almost	sounds	cut-and-paste.

		- Payment	by	cheque	or	money	transfer	(PayPal,	e-transfer).




	- How	to	protect	yourself

		- Call someone you trust to get a second opinion.
		- Do some research on the buyer.
		- Authenticate payments before shipping the goods.
		- If 	possible,	make	the	exchange	in	person	(public	place,	not	alone,	during	the day,	etc.).
		- Don’t	just	communicate	over	email:	ask	for	a	phone	number	(if 	the	buyer won’t	give	it	to	you,	it’s	a	sign	of	trouble).
		- Take	your	time;	don’t	rush	into	anything.
		- Don’t	feel	pressured	into	doing	something	you’re	unsure	about.
		- Trust your instincts.




- Counterfeit products

	- You	can	be	scammed	when	buying	online	by	using	websites	that	appear	to	sell	popular
brands but actually sell counterfeit ones.


		- Counterfeiters	have	become	proficient	in	producing	websites	that	have	the	same look	and	feel	as	the	legitimate	manufacturer’s.


		- Counterfeit	products	are	far	inferior	and,	in	many	cases,	could	pose	a	significant
health	risk	to	consumers.	For	example,	counterfeit	jackets	have	been	found	to contain	bacteria,	fungus	and	mildew.

	- Warning signs


		- Multiple brands but similar products on one site.


		- Items	on	sale	at	drastically	reduced	prices	(75,	80	even	90%	off).


		- Spelling	mistakes	in	website	or	hyperlink.


		- The only real contact point is through email.


		- Broken	English/general	wording	(cut-and-paste)	when	communicating.


		- Contact	email	is	from	Gmail,	Hotmail	or 	Yahoo	(manufacturers	usually	use	their company	email).

	- How	to	protect	yourself


		- Do	 your	research	before	buying	anything	(return	policy,	seller’s	feedback,	etc.).


		- Call	the	company’s	toll-free	number.	Don’t	be	afraid	to	ask	questions.


		- Use	your	credit	card	and	check	your	bank	statements.


		- Avoid	clicking	pop-up	ads	and	links	to	“great	deals.”


		- If 	it	looks	too	good	to	be	true...	it is.

#### 3.3 In Practice

DO	think	critically.

DO be suspicious of urgent requests for money and impossible deals.

DO	be	confident	enough	to	contact	a	company	yourself	to	check.
