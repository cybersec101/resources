## Background and Detail for Trainer

### 1 What the Internet is used for

#### 1.1 In Brief

The	Internet	connects	people	and	information through services	such	as	email,	games,	social media, online banking,	entertainment	and	video	chat.

#### 1.2 In Detail


- The	Internet	combines	advances	in	information technology	(which	have	greatly	increased	our capacity	for 	storing	and	managing	information)	with	advances	in	communications	technology
(which	allow	us	to	transfer	greater	amounts	of	information	more	easily).


- This	means	we	can:

	- Access	the	kind	of	information	we	are	accustomed	to	seeing	in	print	and	on	television	such as	books,	magazines	news	articles,	shows,	movies,	etc.

	- Create	and	publish	our	own	information.

	- Use	new	forms	of	media,	like	constantly-updated	reference	material	and	crowd-sourced publications	such	as:

		- Wikipedia.org;


		- Photo	collections	at	the	New	York	Public	Library [^footnote1];





		- Teaching	initiatives	such	as	Khan	Academy [^footnote2] and 





		- Online	research	tools	like	Google	n-Grams [^footnote3] and	Wolfram	alpha [^footnote4].





There	are	3.2	billion	Internet	users,	2	billion	of	whom	live	in	developing	countries[^footnote5].




	

- Besides	the	well-established	uses	such	as	email	and	online	bulletin	boards	or	forums,	use	of
social	media	services	is	growing.

	- 62%	of	adults	in	the	USA	use	Facebook;	70%	of	those	use	it	daily[^footnote6].





- Canadians	generally	use	the	Internet	for	entertainment,	news,	email	(89%),	banking	(69%)	and
personal	interests	(64%).	The	popularity	of 	video	chatting	and	games	is	increasing	rapidly[^footnote7].





#### 1.3 In Practice

DO	use	the	Internet	to	enrich	your	life	by	gaining	better	access	to	information	and	as	an
additional	way 	to	communicate.

### 2 There are risks on the Internet

#### 2.1 In Brief

The	risks	on	the	Internet	relate	mainly	to:

- The	difficulty	of 	keeping	information	private	on	a	technology	designed	for	sharing;
- Knowing	whom	or	what	to	trust;	and
- Proving	you	are	who	you	say	you	are.

#### 2.2 In Detail

- The	large-scale	digitization	and	connection	of	information	has	a	downside.

	- The	information	and	technologies	can	be	used	for	criminal	purposes.
	- Criminals	can	take	advantage	of 	the	 current	issues	in	 authenticating	identity	and	authorizing
activities	as	well	as	of	low-cost	global	access	and	industrial-scale	automation	to	find	new
scams	and	frauds.

	
- The	cost	of	cybercrime	and	cyber	security	is	estimated	in	millions	and	billions	of	dollars[^footnote8]. However,	estimations	don’t	explain	the	privacy	and	security	implications	of	the	technology,
and	don’t	put	the	risks	into	a	helpful	perspective.



	- The	situation	as	described	and	explained	in	countless	studies	on	the	subject	point	to	a	bad situation	that	is	getting	worse.

	- On	the	bright	side,	many	of 	these	studies	point	to	education	as	a	positive	influence,	so
teaching	this	course	is	a	step	in	the	right	direction.

#### 2.3 In Practice

DO	be	aware	of	dangers	online	and	learn	to	minimize	risk.

### 3 The Internet is made up of connected computers

#### 3.1 In Brief

	
The	Internet	is	made	up	of	millions	of	computers	linked	together	to	allow	information	to	flow
freely	between	them.

- The	technology	used	is	very	trusting.	Security	is	not	built	into	the	Internet	and	should	never
be	assumed.

#### 3.2 In Detail

- The	Internet	developed	out	of	many	projects	but	a	defining	point	in	its	establishment	was
the	connection	of	a	number	of 	stand-alone	research	and	university	networks	to	enable
greater	communication.

	- The	continuing	development	of	the	Internet	reflects	this,	with	a	number	of 	backbones
connecting	networks	together	for 	operation[^footnote9].



- The technologies that enable the Internet are best understood as layers of operating
protocols	and	common	standards	that	work	together	to	manage	tasks	as	simple	as
passing	a	signal	from	one	device	to	another	or 	as	complex	as	managing	network	services
for 	applications[^footnote10].



- You	don’t	have	to	understand	how	everything	works	to	use	the	Internet.



- To	better	understand	security	perspective	it	is	helpful	to	understand	how	the	Transmission
Control	Protocol	(TCP)[^footnote11] and	the	Internet	Protocol	(IP)	function.


	- TCP 	breaks	messages	down	into	tiny	pieces,	like	tearing	all	the	pages	out	of	a	book.
	- IP	gets	those	pieces	to	the	receiver,	handling	them	like	putting	each	page	into	a	separate
envelope	(packet)	and	writing	the	address	for	the	receiver	and	the	sender	on	it	correctly.
	- TCP 	puts	them	all	the	pages	back	together	in	the	correct	order	for 	the	receiver [^footnote12].



- Routing	is	like	a	postal	system.	If	you	imagine	a	global	system	handled	by	a	few	billion
volunteers,	you	understand	the	amount	of	trust	in	the	handlers	required.

	- Unlike	a	real	envelope,	TCP 	does	not	seal	the	package	or	show	if 	it	has	been	tampered	with
in	transit.

	- There	is	no	sure	way 	to	confirm	that	the	envelope	actually	came	from	the	sender	and	not
from	someone	else.

	- Every	one	of	the	hundreds	of	systems	that	handle	the	message	en	route	are	trusted	to	not
read,	delete	or	alter	the	packages	—	 but there is no way of knowing if they do.


		- Because	of	this,	it	is	important	to	keep	information	private	by	encrypting	messages
in	packets	in	order	to:


			- Prevent	others	from	reading	them	and
			- Be	sure	that	the	contents	are	from	the	correct	sender.




		- In	an	Internet	browser,	a	web	address	starting	with	‘https://’	indicates	the	use	of
encryption	on	the	connection.

#### 3.3 In Practice

DO	 check	for 	security	features	such	as	 encryption,	before	sending	or	receiving	valuable	information.

### 4 What is an ISP (Internet Service Provider)?

#### 4.1 In Brief

An	ISP	provides	a	connection	to	the	Internet.	ISPs	can	provide	service	to	a	fixed	point,	like
a	home,	or	to	a	mobile	point,	like	a	cellular	telephone.

#### 4.2 In Detail

	
- Canada	has	many	ISPs.

	- Many	ISPs	buy	wholesale	services	from	other	ISPs	and	resell	them.

	
- Access	to	physical	infrastructure	limits	Internet	access	across	Canada.

	
- How	ISPs	connect	to	the	rest	of	the	Internet	is	important	to	consider.

	- The	far	North	of	Canada	is	connected	to	the	Internet	via	England,	Ireland,	Japan,	Alaska
and	Seattle.

	- Much	of	the	Internet	traffic	in	Canada	travels	through	the	United	States	due	to	the	major
connection	points	to	Asia	near	Seattle	and	to	Europe	in	New	York [^footnote13].





	- Messages	between	two	points	in	the	same	city,	even	the	same	house	could	travel	to
another	country	before	reaching	their	destination.

- On	a	mobile	device,	you	connect	to	your	ISP 	through	a	wireless	connection	to	a	nearby	service
tower.	The	speed	of	mobile	connections	has	improved	over	time.

	- Each	advance	was	significant	enough	to	be	known	as	different	generations	of	technology.
We have advanced through 2nd Generation	(2G)	and	 3rd Generation	(3G).	The	current standard	is	4G	Long	Term	Evolution	or	4G	LTE [^footnote14].





	- The	type	of	connection	on	your	device	is	normally	shown	on	the	screen	where	the
connection	strength	is	shown	(the	bars). 3rd
	Generation	and	later	connections	offer	good service	and	a	level	of 	security [^footnote15].




	


- It	is	important	to	know	who	your	ISP 	is	as	it	is	often	a	good	source	of	support	for	issues	that
you	might	have	connecting	to	the	Internet.

#### 4.3 In Practice

DO	know	how	to	contact	your	ISP.

Do	look	for	a	3G,	4G	or	LTE	symbol	on	 your	smartphone	before	using	the	Internet	to	ensure	a safer	connection.

### 5 The Internet at home

#### 5.1 In Brief

	

- Broadband	Internet	connections	allow	home	networks	to	access	the	Internet.

	
- Wireless	home	networks	(Wi-Fi)	should	be	used	with	the	security	features	turned	on.

#### 5.2 In Detail



- A	home	Internet	connection	in	Canada	can	connect	through	ADSL,	DSL,	fibre	optic	cable,
coaxial	cable	and	fixed	wireless.

	- This	connection	is	generally	a	broadband	or	high-speed	connection,


		- These	connections	have	similar	properties;	they	are	permanently	connected	and permit	a	high	rate	of	data	transfer.

	- Dial-up	connections	(an	older	type	of	connection	that	used	the	same	wire	as	the	telephone)
have	different	properties.	A	dial	up	connection	is	considered	technically	inferior	and	should be	unnecessary	in	Canada [^footnote16].



- Internet	at	home	starts	with	a	cable	connecting	to	a	network	in	the	street	(or	to	an	antenna	in
the	case	of	fixed	wireless).

	- This	cable	will	be	connected	to	a	modem	inside	your	home.	A	modem	is	a	box	with
continually	flashing	lights	that	is	generally	supplied	by	your	ISP.

	- A	network	router	(wireless	or	wired)	connects	to	the	modem	to	manage	communications	to the	Internet [^footnote17].



	- The	router	and	the	modem	maybe	integrated	into	a	single	device.
	- All	the	Internet-enabled	devices	in	your	home	connect	to	the	router.



- Home	Internet-enabled	devices	can	connect	directly	to	the	router	through	wires	or	through
the	air	over	radio	waves.

	- Connecting	with	a	wire	keeps	all	the	communications	within	the	wire	and	provides	a
nice,	controlled	pathway	for 	the	signals	but	is	a	little	impractical	because	the	device	is
essentially	tied	to	the	wall.

	- Wireless	connections	in	a	home	network	are	possible	with	Wi-Fi	technology.


		- Wi-Fi	technologies	transmit	data	through	the	air	and	allow	devices	to	move	while transmitting	and	receiving	data.

		- They	enable	a	single	Wi-Fi	base	station	to	support	a	network	with	many	devices.


		- Neighbours	have	their	own	separate	Wi-Fi	networks	even	if	they	are	within	range of 	each	other.

			- This	function	relies	on	the	devices	deliberately	ignoring	messages	that	are not	intended	for	them.	This	means	that	it	is	possible	to	listen	passively	just	by not	ignoring	the	messages [^footnote18].


		- Secure	Wi-Fi	requires	a	password	to	connect	to	the	network.

			- Devices	without	the	password	are	unable	to	decipher	the	communications	on the	network.

			- A	secure	network	may	be	set	up	by	default	by	the	technician	from	the	ISP.

			- On	an	Apple	computer	a	secure	network	is	indicated	by	a	padlock	symbol
next	to	the	signal	strength	meter	where	the	Wi-Fi	network	status	is	shown
(usually	by 	clicking	on	the	Wi-Fi	icon	at	the	right	of	the	menu	bar,	near
the	clock).

			- On	a	Windows	computer	a	secure	network	is	indicated	by	the	absence	of a	 yellow	shield	next	to	the	signal	strength	meter	where	the	Wi-Fi	network
status	is	shown	(usually	by 	clicking	on	the	Wi-Fi	icon	at	the	bottom	right	of
the	status	bar,	near	the	clock).

			- WPA	and	WPA2	are	security	protocols	used	to	encrypt	all	your	information	as it	travels	through	your	wireless	network.	They	are	more	recent	and	offer	more secure	Wi-Fi	networks	than	older	protocols	(WEP).

#### 5.3 In Practice

DO	ensure	your	home	Wi-Fi	network	is	secured	with	WPA	or 	WP2	as	the	secure	type	and	a unique	and	strong	password.



### 6 The Internet outside the home

#### 6.1 In Brief

Networks	outside	the	home	can	be	less	secure	than	a	home	network	because	more	people use	them.

Take	extra	care	when	sharing	information	if	you	connect	to	these	networks.

#### 6.2 In Detail


- A	private	network	is	one	to	which	access	is	restricted	to	a	known	group	of	people	or	devices.

	- With	a	home	network,	you	only	give	the	password	to	trusted	family	members	and	friends who	visit	regularly.

	- With	a	corporate	network,	a	company	provides	access	to	its	network	to	a	restricted	set	of
people	and	maintains	a	list	of	their	names.

	


- A	public	network	has	little	restriction	or	accounting	of	who	uses	the	network.

	- A	local	café	where	all	customers	get	the	password	or	it	is	written	on	a	board	is	an	example.


		- There is no way of knowing who or what is also connected to this network or what
their	intentions	are.

	-  This	also	applies	to	computers	provided	for	public	use.


		- There	is	no	way 	of 	being	sure	that	another	user	hasn’t	tampered	with	the	computer before	you	started	using	it.

			- They	might	have	installed	software	or	devices	that	track	your	use	and	try	to record	your	personal	information [^footnote19].




	- These	systems	may	not	be	secure,	as	public	networks	make	a	valuable	target	to	criminals
due	to	the	large	number	of 	network	users	who	are	potential	victims.


		- Another	issue	with	connecting	to	public	networks	is	that	you	must	trust	the
security	awareness	of	the	person	providing	the	connection.	Even	major	hotels
have	been	affected	with	security	issues	that	put	the	users	of	the	private	hotel
network	at	risk [^footnote20].




			- Be	sure	that	you	are	connecting	to	the	network	provided	by	the	hotel,	not
another	unofficial	network	with	a	similar	name.	Connecting	to	an	unofficial
network	would	allow	unknown	administrators	to	be	aware	of	your
online	activities.



			- Ask	an	employee	for	the	exact	name	of	their	Wi-Fi	network	to	make	sure	you
are	connecting	to	the	correct	one.

#### 6.3 In Practice

DO	be	careful	what	information	you	share	when	connecting	to	public	networks,	wherever
possible	avoid	sensitive	transactions.

DO	use	your	3G	or	4G	connection	if	you	have	to	send	or	receive	private	information	outside the	home.
