This document is a reference and preparation sheet for the trainer, and a companion to the lesson plan.

The Learning Objectives summarize the knowledge that learners should have gained by the time they reach the end of the module.

The Background and Detail for Trainer provides greater details on the content, and links to references. It will allow trainers to learn more about the topic so they can lead discussions or answer questions confidently without being limited to the classroom content. Each item in the Background supports a section in the Lesson Script.

### Learning objectives

- An understanding of the risks of installing new applications and games

- An understanding of why updates are important

- Ability to set up automatic patching


## Background and Detail for Trainer

### 1 The risks of installing new applications and games

#### 1.1 In Brief

Applications are what make computers great but they can also cause problems

-	Install only the programs you need.

-	Install new applications only from trustworthy sources, and read the screen prompts^
(dialogue boxes) carefully.

#### 1.2 In Detail

- Backups are important. Copy (back up) your data frequently in case something happens to the
original (for example, you lose your smartphone).


- Millions of computer programs or applications are available to use on our computers and
devices.

- The freedom for anyone to develop applications to solve problems has made computers very
useful.

	- The quality of the programs can vary greatly as there is no minimum standard for operation

-	The complexity of software means that every program on your computer and their millions of
lines of code represent a potential hidden flaw.

	- Every program installed on a computer or on a smart phone could contain an exploitable
    vulnerability.
	- The risk is quite low but you can take steps to minimize the chance of installing poor quality
    software.
	- Download software from official and controlled sources and sites:

		- Google Play: Google’s official store for downloading software for Android devices.
		- Apple iTunes store: Apple’s official store for downloading software for iOS devices.
		- Recognized software manufacturer websites.

			- Large software companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, Google, Intuit, etc.
    provide downloads from their sites.
	- Downloading software from other sites, particularly those advertising a large amount of free
software can be risky as the site operator is probably not monitoring the quality and content
of the applications.
	- Installing illegal versions of software is even more risky as these applications are often
implanted with malware or, at the very least, are cut off from the manufacturer’s updates
that keep the software safe.

- Reduce the risk of flaws on your system by uninstalling software that you no longer use, no
longer need, or is no longer being updated by the manufacturer.

- Many software providers arrange with other software providers for secondary software to
install at the same time as their product.

	- This is attractive to some companies whose software is not of great benefit to users.

		- An example is a toolbar for a web browser that provides a few buttons in exchange
for sending a record of your Internet use to marketing companies.
		- This kind of software is known as spyware.

- Do not install this software.

	- Most companies will give you the option to install or not.
	- It is very important to read the directions during the installation process of the
software you are installing.

	- Often, the option to install is selected by default, and you will need to
    manually deselect the installation [Note 1](#note-1).

- ![Image not available](/images/EN_A_Healthy_Computer_01.png "Read Carefully to be sure what will be installed")

-	_Image : Read the instructions during the process of installation carefully to see if a secondary application will be installed_

- Read carefully when installing applications.

- Many applications, particularly those on mobile devices, collect more information than
    necessary.

- Reading the information in the screen prompts presented at installation can alert
you that a piece of software presents a risk to your privacy.

- An Android phone will alert you to the services an application is asking for at
    installation. You can then choose to continue installing the application, or not.

- For example, you might give a weather application access to your
location, as it should know where you are to provide appropriate
information. You would choose not to install a weather application that
wants to access your microphone or contacts (address book).

- View the applications with a critical eye before installing.

- Being a little vigilant can help you understand what you have installed and what it does.
- When installing software, enable automatic updates if that option is available.

#### 1.3 In Practice

Do look for software from legitimate sources, and read everything carefully during the
installation process.

#### 2 Why set up automatic updates/patches

#### 2.1 In Brief

Modern software is designed to be updated (or patched) regularly to improve it and remedy
security problems. Updating regularly greatly increases the security of your computer or device

#### 2.2 In Detail

- Modern software is very complex.

- Little mistakes or errors in the code can be exploited by criminals, leaving you and your systems vulnerable to harm.

	- Applications are constantly being added to, improved or modified to better suit people’s
    changing needs.

		- This takes a lot of effort from companies. Sometimes, security is overlooked or not
looked at hard enough.

		- After an application is released, responsible companies put a lot of effort into
    finding and/or fixing problems with the code.
		- Applying these fixes to your computer is typically easy to do, and often can
    be automated.
		- Some companies schedule regular fixes so that everyone can be prepared for
    them.

			- For example, Microsoft sends out fixes for its software on the first
Tuesday of every month. These fixes are referred to as patches or
updates, depending on the kind of changes being made.
	- Use legitimate software that provides access to this update service. Illegal copies
of software normally cannot be updated.

- Installing updates ensures your computer is as secure as possible.

	- Being familiar with how this works can help you notice when something else is
being installed instead.

	- Being better aware of the normal process of updating helps you spot abnormalities
on your computer, such as a fake update window.

- Set your computer to automatically install updates.
