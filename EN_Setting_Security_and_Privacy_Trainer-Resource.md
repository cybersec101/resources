- Understand why you should cover the camera on your computer

- Ability	to	configure	security	and	privacy	settings	on	your	devices




## Background and Detail for Trainer

### 1	 	Configuring	security	and privacy

#### 1.1 In Brief

Setting	passwords,	switching	firewalls	on	and	checking	privacy	settings	are	important	steps	in securing	your	computer.

#### 1.2 In Detail


- Computer	password.

	- Use	the	password	lock	to	open	your	computer—even	if	you	are	the	only	one	who	uses the	computer.


		- A password provides a basic level of accountability within the computer and can prevent	somebody	else	from	seeing	or	using	your	data	if	the	computer	is	lost or	stolen.

		- A	good	password	is	as	complex,	long,	unique	and	memorable	as	it	is	practical,	see the	lesson	on	‘Identifying	yourself’	for 	more	help	on	passwords.

	- To	change	your	password	on:


		- _Apple_:	Go	to	 **_Apple menu_** 	at	the	top	left	of	screen,	then	 **_System Preferences > Users & groups >_** Click	 **_Change password_**.


		- _Windows_:	Go	to	 **_Control panel > user accounts and family safety > Change password_**.




- Computer	firewall	(computer	network	safety	barrier):

	- To	enable	the	firewall	on	 your	computer [Note 1](#note-1) on:




		- _Apple_:	Go	to	 **_Apple menu_** 	at	the	top	left	of	screen,	then	 **_System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Firewall_**. Turn	the	firewall	on	(you	may	have	to	click	on	the
padlock	icon	at	the	bottom	left	of	this	box	and	enter	a	username	and	password	to do	this).




		- _Windows_:	In	 **_Search_**, type **_Firewall_**, and then select **_Windows Firewall_**. Select **_Turn
Windows Firewall On_** [Note 2](#note-2).







- Computer	privacy	settings:

	- Devices	connected	to	the	Internet	often	communicate	with	external	services.




		- In	some	cases,	this	communication	can	be	more	than	expected	or	required.

		- Make	sure	that	the	operating	system	is	not	sending	out	more	information	than	you are	comfortable	with.

		- This is a balance and is a personal choice about what to share and which features are	 worth a loss in privacy.	It	is	important	to	make	a	choice and not accept the manufacturers	assumptions.

			- Apple	and	Windows	computers	both	have	adjustable	settings	that	control	the amount	of	information	sent	out	through	the	Internet.

			- To	choose	to	adjust	settings	for	the	greatest	privacy,	but	lose	some	features:


				- Apple


	 				- Go	to	Apple	menu	at	the	top	left	of	screen,	then	 **_System
Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results_**, 	and	uncheck	the	boxes
for **_Spotlight Suggestions_** and **_Bing Web Searches_**.


	 				- Go	to	 **_System Preferences > Security & Privacy_** and select the **_Privacy tab_**.


	 				- Select the **_Location Services_** tag.


	 				- Select	which	applications can access to your	location	information.

	 					- If 	you	don’t	want information to adjust	automatically	based	on your	location, turn them all off.
	 					- You	can	manually	set your location for weather	applications.

	 					- If you choose to have some applications access your location automatically,	uncheck the other applications,	click	on	the system	services button and uncheck	the	 **_Safari_** and **_Spotlight Suggestions_** option.
	 					- : ![Image Missing](/images/Setting_Security_and_Privacy_01.png "Setting Spotlight Suggestions")


	 				- Disable	automatic	web	searches.


						- **_System Preferences_** > **_Spotlight_** > **_Search Results_** 	and	uncheck the	boxes	for **_Spotlight Suggestions_** and **_Bing Web Searches_**.




				- Windows [Note 3](#note-3)




	 				- Go	to	 Settings > Privacy > General.

						- Let	apps	use	my	advertising	ID:	Turn	this	off.



						- Turn on **_SmartScreen Filter:_** This	is	a	feature	to	block	some known	malicious	sites.	Leave	this	on.

						- Switch	off	Microsoft	 **_how I write._**

						- If 	you	prefer	French,	websites	providing	local	content	can advise	sites	to	switch	language	modes.	Otherwise	turn	it	off.


	 				- Turn Cortana Off.

						- Bring	up	the	 **_Start_** 	menu	and	start	typing.	Click	on	the	notebook icon in the left sidebar and choose **_Settings_**. Turn	off	Cortana.

						- **_Search online and include web results._** When	you	turn	off Cortana,	this	option	will	appear.	Turn	it	off.


	 				- Go	to	 **_Settings > Privacy > Speech, Inking, & Typing_**.


						- Click	the	 **_“Stop Getting to Know Me”_** button to **_turn Getting to know you off_**.




				- Microsoft	Edge	(Windows 10’s	new	browser)


					- Like	most	modern	browsers	(including	Chrome	and	Firefox),	Edge
includes	features	that	“phone	home.”	You	will	find	them	in	Edge’s
**_Settings > Advanced Settings_**. 	Here’s	what	they	do:

						- **_Have Cortana assist me in Microsoft Edge_** 	tracks	your	browsing
history	so	it	can	reference	it	when	you	ask	Cortana	questions.
You	can	turn	this	feature	off	in	Edge’s	advanced	settings.

						- **_Show search suggestions as I type._** 	Edge	logs	your	keystrokes
to	give	you	search	predictions	as	you	type.	You	can	turn	this
feature	off	at	 “Show search suggestions as I type” here.

						- **_Help protect me from malicious sites and downloads_** with SmartScreen	Filter.	Leave	this	turned	on.


	 				- Under Settings > Privacy > Feedback & Diagnostics are two	settings:

						- **_Feedback frequency:_** 	change	it	to	 **_Never._**

						- **_Diagnostic and usage data:_** 	Change	this	to	 **_Basic._**


	 				- Location

						- Go	to	 **_Settings_** > **_Privacy Location._** If you plan to move a lot
with	the	computer	and	would	like	it	to	update	things	such	as
weather	settings	automatically,	leave	them	on	here.	Otherwise
turn	them	all	off.


				- Mobile	Device	Screen	lock


					 - Locking	the	screen	on	a	mobile	device	is	very	important.	This provides	a	basic	level	of 	security.	If	the	phone	is	lost,	it	makes	it more	difficult	for	someone	to	access	your	information and	services.


	 				- Where	possible	use	a	password	with	letters	and	numbers.

	 				- Using	the	fingerprint	scanning	service	is	a	good	option.	If	you	use a	pattern,	avoid	simple	shapes	(L	shape,	triangle,	square)	and wipe	the	screen	regularly	to	clean	the	smudge	from	the	pattern from	the	screen.	If	you	use	a	four-digit	code	avoid	simple	patterns (1234,	0000,	2580,	1111,	5555,	5683,	0852,	1212,	or	your	birth	year). These	are	not	good	passcodes [Note 4](#note-4).







				- iPhone


	 				- On	devices	with	Touch	ID	(fingerprint	scanner),	Go	to	 **_Settings > Touch ID & Passcode_** and **_set a passcode_**. 	Setting	up	Touch	ID	for
iPhone	unlock	is	handy	too,	just	follow	the	prompts	after	selecting
this	option.

					- On	devices	without	Touch	ID,	go	to	 Settings > Passcode: Tap run pass	code	on [Note 5](#note-5).




				- Android


					- Open	your	device's	 **_Settings_** app ![Image Missing](/images/Setting_Security_and_Privacy_02.png). Scroll	down	and	touch Security.	Touch	 **_Screen lock_**.

						- If 	you	already	set	a	lock,	enter	the	pattern,	PIN	or	password before	choosing	a	different	lock.

						- Touch	the	screen	lock	you	want	to	use	and	follow	the instructions [Note 6](#note-6).





#### 1.3 In Practice

DO	set	passwords,	turn	on	security	and	configure	your	privacy	on	 your	computer	and mobile	device.

### 2	 Security	software

#### 2.1 In Brief

Security	software	helps	manage	your	security.	It	is	sold	as	a	subscription	that	has	to	be	renewed regularly.	An	anti-virus	and	active	monitoring	software	package	is	recommended.

#### 2.2 In Detail



- Security	software	is	designed	to	protect	you	from	malware.

	- Like	locks	on	doors	and	bars	on	windows,	they	do	not	guarantee	security.

	- No	security	software	can	provide	total	protection.



		- It	is	not	a	substitute	for	caution.	An	airbag	in	a	car	will	not	prevent	you	from	having an	accident,	and	it	won’t	help	you	if	you	are	not	wearing	your	seatbelt.

		- Its	presence	can	prevent	a	little	accident	from	becoming	something	far	worse.

	- It	is	 very	important	to	have	security	software	to	assist	you,	but	it	is	only	one	part	of	your security	plan.




- Electronics	and	office	supplies	retailers often have a large	choice	of	security	software.

	- There	is	no	good	way 	of 	recommending	which	product	to	buy,	but	there	is	a	list	of	what	not
to	buy.	Many	applications	claim	to	be	anti-virus	software	but	are	actually	scams	or	viruses
themselves.

[comment]: # (there was a footnote after the word themselves. link not working = http://www.asafercomputer.co.uk/?q=Library)




	- When	buying	security	software,	you	are	buying	a	service	as	much	as	you	are	buying a	product.

		- Threats	and	malware	on	the	Internet	change	constantly.	Your	security	software
should	adapt	to	defend	properly	against them.

			- The company you buy your security software from will need to update it	constantly.


		- Subscription	details	differ	between	offerings.

			- Ask	how	long	the	subscription	is	for	and	how	many	machines	it	protects.

			- Often,	the	subscription	will	need	to	be	renewed	each	year.

			- Keep	the	subscription	up-to-date	to	protect	against	current	threats.




- Security	software	can	affect	your	computer’s	performance.

	- This	is	because	it	reads	files	as	you	access	them	to	make	sure	that	they	are	safe.

		- There	is	no	way 	to	avoid	this	reduction	in	performance.

			- Software	companies	work	very	hard	to	minimize	the	impact	of	their	software on	performance.

			- Most	of	the	popular	security	software	providers	(the	kinds	sold	on	those shelves)	only	reduce	performance	by	a	small	amount [Note 8](#note-8).







			- If 	your	computer	slows	down	a	lot	after	installing	new	security	software	it may	be	for	one	or	more	of	the	following	reasons:


				- The older software was not uninstalled;




				- There	is	not	enough	free	space	on	your	hard	disk	(approximately	20%	is needed	as	a	work	area	for	the	computer);


				- Software	needs	updating;



				- Too	much	software	is	running	on	the	computer;	or


				- The	computer	is	just	too	old	to	run	modern	software	(always	read	the system	requirements	before	buying	software).


- More	is	not	better.

	- You	should	only	have	one	security	suite	installed	on	your	computer.


		- Having	several	running	at	once	will	result	in	conflicts	that	might	slow	down	your computer	or 	cause	it	to	malfunction.



- Consider	how	intrusive	the	software	is.

	- Some	software	will	tell 	you	constantly	that	it	is	working;	others	will	work	quietly	in the	background	and	nearly	never	let	 you	know	they	are	there.	This	is	a	matter	of personal	preference.


		- Most	of	the	popular	security	software	providers	allow	you	to	customize	this	element.


- Consider	what	functions	come	with	the	software.

	- This	can	be	confusing,	as	there	is	a	lot	of	marketing	speak,	jargon	and	flashy	graphics.	The	 functions	of	these	software	packages	can	be	broken	down	into:




What is it?|Also called|What it does
-----|:------|:-----
Network security tools|Firewalls,	intrusion detection systems, intrusion	protection systems|Finds	and	stops bad network traffic	(data	in	and	out	sent from	Malware)
Active detection|Instant	Messaging	(IM) protection, anti-spam,	anti-phishing	detection, ad-blocking software, privacy filter|Finds	software	program	code with malicious functions in the application	you	are	using and blocks them
Content	filter|Child	filter,	parental filter| Restricts the use of the computer to safer websites
Anti-virus|Anti-malware	(virus,	etc.), Windows Defender and Apple Security|Examines	files	as	they	are used and scans all	files	on	a	regular basis to determine if they are performing	undesirable	or unauthorized actions on the computer
Secure deletion|File	Shredder|Deletes	files so they cannot be recovered
Network	and anonymity|Virtual	Private Networks (VPN)|Provides a more secure connection and conceals your location



- Use	a	security	service	that	provides	anti-virus	and	active	detection	as	a	minimum security	solution.

	- Computers	with	Windows	8	or	newer	and	Apple	computers	come	with	some built-in	protection.


		- These	applications	are	not	dedicated	to	providing	security	so	they	may	not	provide the	same	level	of 	security	or 	allow	you	to	customize	alerts	and	notifications	as	a specialized	application.



- Be	aware	of	service	scams.	Microsoft	will	not	call	you.	A	legitimate	security	software	company will	not	call	you.


>**_Microsoft/Windows technician scam_**


>Scammers	call,	pretend	to	represent	a	well-known	company	like	Microsoft	or	Apple	and
claim	that	the	victim’s	computer	is	sending	out	viruses	or	has	been	hacked	and	must
be	cleaned.	The	scammer	will	gain	access	to	the	computer	remotely	and	may	run	some
programs	or	change	some	settings.	The	scammer	will	then	advise	that	a	fee	is	required
for 	the	services	and	request	a	credit	card	number	to	cover	the	payment.	In	some	cases,
the	scammer	will	send	a	transfer	from	the	victims’	computer	through	a	money	service	like
Western	Union	or	MoneyGram.	The	result	is	that	the	victim	pays	for	a	service	that	was	not
needed	as	the	computer	was	never	infected [Note 9](#note-9).


>If 	you	receive	a	call	like	this,	do	not	provide	any	information	to	them.	Hang	up.	You can	report	it	to	the	Canadian	Anti-Fraud	Centre:	1-888-495-8501	or	[Anti-fraud Centre.ca](http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/reportincident-signalerincident/index-eng.htm)



#### 2.3 In Practice

DO	install	security	software	to	help	you	maintain	the	safety	of 	your	computer.

DO	keep	your	subscription	up	to	date.

### 3	 Covering	the	webcam

#### 3.1 In Brief

A	webcam	cover	protects	against	spying through	a	webcam.

#### 3.2 In Detail


- It	is	possible	for	an	attacker	to	access	your	computer	remotely	without	your	knowledge [Note 10](#note-10).


	- There	are	malicious	programs	that	secretly	provide	another	person	with	access	to	your computer;	often	called	Remote	Access	Trojan	programs	(RAT) [Note 11](#note-11). A	criminal	might	trick	you into	installing	the	malware	by	hiding	it	inside	another	file	or	program	or	by 	having	you	click a	link	or	visiting	a	bad	webpage.		They	can	then	see	what	you	do	on	the	computer,	have access	to	your	files	and	activate	the	camera	and	microphone.


		- Covering	the	 webcam	ensures	that	they	cannot	see	into	your	home	and	guarantees a	minimum	level	of 	privacy.




- Covering	your	webcam	is	simple.

	- Just	stick	a	piece	of	paper	over	the	camera	lens	and	only	remove	it	when	you	are	actually using	the	webcam.

	- You	can	also	use	the	little	sticky	labels	on	bananas	or	other	fruit	and	vegetables.	They	do not	damage	the	screen	and	come	off	easily.

	- You	can	buy	prettier	webcam	covers,	but	they	do	the	same	job	as	the	piece	of	paper	or the	label.

#### 3.3 In Practice


DO	cover	your	webcam.
