#Addressing Online Hate


This document is a reference and preparation sheet for the trainer, and a companion to the lesson plan.

The Learning Objectives summarize the knowledge that learners should have gained by the time they reach the end of the module.

The Background and Detail for Trainer provides greater details on the content, and links to references. It will allow trainers to learn more about the topic so they can lead discussions or answer questions confidently without being limited to the classroom content. Each item in the Background supports a section in the Lesson Script.

### Learning objectives

- Be able to recognize and identify forms of hate speech and discrimination, in one’s own
community and in broader society.

- Understand and explain how online media is used to disseminate hate speech/discrimination.

- Be able to create and participate in non-discriminatory dialogue online.


## Background and Detail for Trainer

### 1 Awareness of Forms of Hate

#### 1.1 In Brief

Messages that instill hate, promote hate or seek to exclude people based on their membership
to a group are harmful and can be illegal. It is vital to be able to identify hate speech.

#### 1.2 In Detail

- Equality is an important human right and each person has right to be free from discrimination.
    
    - There are many laws that guarantee this right:

		- The 1st and 2nd articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights [Note 1](#note-1).


		- The 2nd and 15th articles of the Canadian Constitution[Note 2](#note-2).


		- The 3rd and 10th articles of the Quebec Constitution[Note 3](#note-3).


- Freedom can be threatened by expressions of hate online

- Hate speech is a crime in Canada.
   
    - Hate speech compromises the basic right to not face hostility, violence, or discrimination
   
    - 	It	has	a	long-term	detrimental	effect	on	the	affected
   
    - 	Hate	crime	can	represent	a	source	of	terror 	for 	members	of	affected	minority	groups
   
    - To be prosecuted as a crime the speech must be public, deliberate, severe, targeted at an
       identifiable	group,	and	hateful	in	its	context.
   
    - The Criminal Code of Canada states that “Every one who, by communicating statements
       in	any 	public	place,	incites	hatred	against	any	identifiable	group	where	such	incitement	is
       likely 	to	lead	to	a	breach	of	the	peace	is	guilty”	of 	an	indictable	or	punishable	offence [Note 4](#note-4). 

	- 	Some	forms	of	speech	are	excluded	from	this	definition	such	as	where:
       

		- the speech is to identify hateful material,

		- an opinion on a religious subject or based in a religous text,

		- true,

		- in the public interest, or
		- satirical.

	- Prosecution of hate speech can only proceed with the approval of the Attorney General,
    which introduces an element of political accountability.


- Hate	speech	generally	portrays	a	group	of	people	as	being	somehow	distinct,	different	from^
most people, and/or “not like us”.

	- 	Hate	speech	(in	the	form	of	text,	images	or	sound)	can	be	identified	by	the	degrading	or
dehumanizing functions that it serves. That is, talking about a group of people as though
they are not human but are something other and somehow lesser [Note 5](#note-5).

	- Distinguishing	between	hate	speech	and	free	speech	can	be	difficult

		- Ideas around free speech and freedom of expression are nuanced

		- It	can	be	difficult	to	define	free	speech	concretely.


	- In many ways, freedom of expression is “an essential human right [Note 6](#note-6).


	- Absolutists of free speech “advocate complete freedom of expression without any
    restrictions whatsoever” [Note 7](#note-7).
   

	- Others see value in placing limits on speech that would cause harm [Note 8](#note-8).

	- In Canada, freedom of expression is not unlimited or absolute.


		- Under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, freedom of expression shall


			- "not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or
    other rights or freedoms", or

			- "be construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in Canada” [Note 9](#note-9).

	- Consequently,	it	is	important	that	citizens	find	non-judgmental	spaces	to	openly	discuss	
their opinions while also encouraging criticality, empathy and tolerance.

- 	Being	able	to	identify	a	problem	is	often	the	first	step	in	the	process	of	solving	a	problem.		So,
it is important to be able to identify expressions of hate and hate speech.

	- Hate speech could appear in:

		- Racially 	motivated	graffiti
		
		- Pamphlets denying that the Holocaust occurred.
		
		- Flyers condemning gay sex as immoral.


	- 	Each	of 	these	examples	defines	and	degrades	a	group	such	as	by	their	race,	religion	or
    sexuality. It can be found in other more local context such as:

		- Receiving poor service or no service because of one's religion.

		- 	Being	called	offensive	names	because	of	one’s	sexuality.

		- 	Being	told	to	“***	off	back	to	your 	own	country”	referring	to	one’s	race.

		- 	Coming	home	to	find	“tranny”	spray-painted	on	your 	fence.

		- Being laughed at or mimicked for having a physical disability [Note 10](#note-10)
		
		- Somone being abused because of their status on a social network.


- To prevent the harms of hate speech, it is important to recognize hate speech and
    marginalization of groups within our local and global communities.

- Awareness of wrongdoing and the law allows us to protect peoples’ rights by: 
	
	- making choices ourselves,
    
    - educating those around us anD
    
    - in extreme cases talking to the police.

#### 1.3 In Practice

DO	recognize	and	identify	different	forms	of	marginalization	against	identifiable	groups.

DO understand why it’s a problem, and the consequences

DO	recognize	and	identify	different	forms	of	marginalization	in	closer	communities	and	more globally

### 2 How and Why Hate is disseminated Online

#### 2.1 In Brief

Social media may be used to propagate hatred, discrimination and, violence toward certain
groups.	It	is	important	to	understand	how	different	online	media	tools	are	used	to	spread	hate
speech and discrimination.

#### 2.2 In Detail

- Hate	speech	online	can	be	identified	as	messages	on	the	Internet	that


	- incite hostility,

	- promote hate, or

	- seek to exclude people based on their group.

- The problems of hate speech online are a concern around the world.

	- The UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues expressed her “concern over the spread of misinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, discrimination and hostility in the media and on Internet, particularly targeted against
Muslim community Communities” [Note 11](#note-11)


- Hate speech is commonly found on online news sites, comments sections, or in other
communications such as emails or text messages (SMS).

	- The Ethical Journalism Network has expressed concern about hate speech making its way
into the news stories published by mainstream media [Note 12](#note-12)


- Hate speech can appear anywhere that comments are able to be made online. Hate speech
doesn’t have to be at a grand scale or in the news to be harmful.
	- For example, gender-based hate speech can be seen in a shared post: “She broke my heart,
I broke her nose.” Although some might dismiss the danger of posts such as this, they can
lead to tremendous harm.

- Hate speech can be transferred by any of the many means of communication that the Internet
provides and may involve individual users or online communities.

- It is important to understand that anyone can publish anything on the Internet, which is made
available to a public or semi-public audience.

	- Publishing can be done anonymously, using a pseudonym, or using one’s real name, and it
is	difficult	to	know	the	difference.

- Social Media provides the ability for anyone to easily and quickly read, share and create
content for their friends and others.

	- Social Media is very common.

		- Nearly two-thirds of Canadians use Social Media. Some common Social Media
platforms include Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and Snapchat.

	- Discriminatory groups online are not rare.

		- SafeHome.org estimates that on Twitter, on average:

			- anti-immigrant groups have more than 17,500 followers;


			- an anti-Muslim group will have 14,500 followers,

			- an anti-LGBT group will have approximately 7,000 followers, and

			- an anti-Semitic group will have approximately 1,524 followers in the U.S. [Note 13](#note-13).

- How people talk on Social Media is becoming normal. It is concerning that the hate speech
being spread online might also be seen as normal and acceptable.

	- Individuals and groups have made use of Social Media to propagate messages of hate

	- 	In	some	ways,	online	hate	speech	is	more	dangerous	than	hate	speech	in	a	confined
context, such as a face-to-face conversation.

	- Online and virtual environments allow speech to be easily dispersed at great speed in a
manner	that	can	be	difficult	to	track.

#### 2.3 In Practice

DO identify online hate speech;

DO understand and explain how Social Media has augmented the extent of hatred and
discrimination;

DO	be	aware	of	the	different	forms	of	Social	Media	involved	in	this	form	of	online	hate.

### 3 Participating in non-discriminatory dialogue and being resilient online

#### 3.1 In Brief

It is important to think critically about the information found online, particularly in terms of how
identifiable	groups	are	represented,	and	to	develop	one’s	sense	of	resilience	and	empathy	in	the
context	of	online	hate.	Use	these	skills	to	find	positive,	tolerant	sites	and	contribute	to	creating	to
non-discriminatory online spaces in which to participate.

#### 3.2 In Detail

- It	is	important	to	understand	that	a	website	or	Social	Media	post	can	look	official	and	
    legitimate without being either.

	- There	is	no	official	system	to	check	that	websites	are	providing	information	that	is	correct,
       or even safe.
- Identifying propaganda sites is not easy because

	- They can be created to look professional and like authentic news sites.
	
	- They 	can	have	an	artificially	large	following	on	Social	Media
	
		- Fake ‘followers’ can be purchased from illegal service providers
		
		- ‘Astroturfing’	is	the	creation	and	management	of	automated	virtual	personas	to mcontribute in Social Media for the purposes of creating the impression of a social
movement.

- It may be tempting to believe that particular news outlets are trustworthy, thereby eclipsing the need for readers to assume a critical position.

	- However, even though some news sources are deemed more trustworthy than others, as
       shown by large-scale survey studies (e.g., The Economist and BBC over the Rush Limbaugh
       Show and BuzzFeed) [Note 14](#note-14) , all news and information on the Internet is inevitably biased and
       distorted and should be read critically.
       
	- Groups have been known to distribute misinformation online with the intention of
       misleading voters or to make money; these stories are sometimes redistributed by
       legitimate media sources.
    
   - Some news outlets are quite disciplined in publicly retracting false or manipulated stories,
       but others might just quietly edit or delete a story proven to be false, if they correct it at all.
   
   - Thinking critically about stories and sites can help to avoid forming opinions based on
       biased or false stories.
       
- In order to be able to identify what is trustworthy, people need to be able to think critically

	- Critical thinking skills empower Internet users to navigate the online world as informed,
       resilient, and empathetic citizens. Everyone can learn to think critically and, with practice, it
       becomes an essential habit.

	- Engaging in systematic questioning will help you recognize errors in reasoning or
       manipulation techniques in Social Media or news sources.

	- Critical thinking can be developed by questioning a site or story.

		- You can ask yourself:

			- What arguments are being made?

			- What evidence is being provided?

			- Who is making the argument?

			- What are the perspectives and assumptions that are present in this article?

			- Whose perspectives are missing?

- Countering hate speech involves developing one’s own resilience and empathy online.


	- Most people will be exposed to hate speech online or in person, so it is important to also
    build resilience in yourself and those around you.

		- Resilience refers to developing the skills necessary to fare well in the face of
adversity.

		- In addition to critical thinking skills, personal qualities that serve to provide
protective powers or resilience in the face of adversity include a belief in one's
abilities, self-esteem, and a strong sense of identity.

		- If	an	individual	is	exposed	to	significant	adversity	online,	resilience	involves	the
“capacity of an individual to navigate his or her way to health-sustaining resources,”
which can be provided by one’s family or community.

		- Resilience in the face of hate speech begins with and understanding of one's
self and “moves toward the development of a shared vision for an inclusive
community”.

	- Empathy is an important tool for helping to creating non-discriminatory online spaces.

		- Empathy refers to the individual’s capacity to understand and respond to the
unique	affective	experiences	of	another 	person.

		- It has been shown that both empathy and perspective are associated with less
prejudice and stereotyping.

			- For example, “Visualizing Empathy” is a program that teaches youth about
    empathy and to apply this through their mobile technologies.

		- Identifying and countering hate speech online can feel overwhelming at times,
particularly when instances of hate are ambiguous.

	- There are online tools that can help:

		- “[Roots of Empathy](https://rootsofempathy.org/)” teaches how to be socially competent citizens.

- “[Who am I?](https://www.commonsense.org/education/app/who-am-i-race-awareness-game)” is a race awareness online game for children.

- It is important to feel that you can talk about these issues in an understanding space.
    
	- Offline	conversations	about	online	behaviours	can	happen	in	community	courses,	in
       classrooms, with friends, and with family.

- It is vital that you know your rights as an individual and the rights of others.

- You	can	report	online	hate	through	official	channels.
    
	- You can report incidents to the platform administrators as well as to the police or law
       enforcement, your workplace management, or your school administration.
       
	- Most online publishing or hosting services include in their terms of service that illegal
       activity will not be permitted through the use of their service. Many have more recently extended	that	to	include	language	more	specific	to	hate	speech.	Reporting	hate	speech	to the company hosting the speech can result in the material being removed.

	- You	can	find	links	to	places	where	 you	can	report	hate	speech	on	the	webpage	for	this	
    module.

#### 3.3 In Practice

DO know your rights as an individual and the rights of others

DO actively question the credibility of what you read and watch online

DO	have	offline	conversations	about	online	behaviour
