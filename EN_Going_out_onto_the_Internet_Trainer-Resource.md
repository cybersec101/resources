It will allow trainers to learn more about the topic so they can lead discussions or answer questions confidently without being limited to the classroom content. Each item in the Background supports a section in the Lesson Script.

### Learning objectives

- Understanding of the risks of browsing

- Knowledge of what to look for in the browser

- Ability	to	configure	browser	settings




## Background and Detail for Trainer

### 1 The risks in the browser

#### 1.1 In Brief

Advertising,	tracking,	drive-by	downloads,	man-in-the-middle	attacks,	typo-squatting	and phishing	all	present	different	types	of	dangers	to	be	wary	of 	online.

#### 1.2 In Detail

There	are	many	forms	of	threat	on	the	Internet.	Being	aware	of	common	forms	can	help	you	to avoid	some	dangers	and—more	importantly—take	action	after	encountering	a	threat	to	minimize the	harm	caused.


- Advertising

	- Intermediaries	and	large	publishers	(such	as	Facebook	or	Google),	which	we	 will	callplatforms,	gather	and	analyze	a	considerable	amount	of	data	at	very	high	speed,	making	it
possible	to	customize	advertising.

	- Advertisers	can	buy	advertising	in	auctions	with	the	cost	depending	on,	the	similarity	of
the	 webpage	and	the	advertisement,	your	location,	your	browsing	history,	or	information
you	gave	to	the	platform	or	its	partners	such	as	through	subscription	questionnaires,	or
information	posted	on	your	social	networking	account	posts.

	- These	new	opportunities	give	firms	extra	incentives	to	acquire	and	use	personal	information
about	consumers,	which	has	led	regulators	and	consumers	to	worry	or 	at	least	to
acknowledge	some	potential	downsides	of	these	practices.

		- Among	the	pitfalls	are	privacy	breaches	or	fraudulent	use	of	personal	information,
behavioural	targeting	and	pricing.

	- As	online	advertising	has	become	more	popular,	criminals	have	started	to	abuse	it.


		- Malvertising	is	one	of	such	activities,	where	an	attacker	uses	advertising	to distribute	malware.

			- Malvertising	can	have	serious	consequences,	because	an	attacker	can	place
malware	on	popular	websites.	Therefore,	the	malicious	content	could	reach	a
very	large	audience.

			- In	addition,	users	may	be	unaware	that	they	could	encounter	malicious
content	while	browsing	highly	reputable	websites,	which	may	put	them
at	risk.

- Tracking

	- Third-party	online	services	bring	tremendous	value	to	the	web:	they	enable	websites	to
easily	benefit	from	advertising,	visitor	counts,	integrating	with	social	networks	and	more.

	- They	also	give	rise	to	privacy	concerns.


	- Third-party	service	providers	make	it	possible	for	advertisers	to	track	your	online	habits	and
browsing	patterns	across	many	websites,	and	tailor	advertising	to	match	these	patterns.




		- Personalized	ads	are	considered	to	be	the	future	of	web	advertising,	and	already
make	up	a	large	portion	of	the	global	online	ad	market.

			- This	increases	the	relevance	of	ads	for	users	and	their	revenues	for	websites
that	have	advertising	on	them.

			- This	kind	of	advertising	has	raised	concerns	with	respect	to	the	use	of	third-
parties	to	track	and	collect	peoples’	data.

			- People	might	not	be	aware	of	how	they	are	being	tracked	between	websites
or the privacy implications and terms of service of the third-party
service	provider.




- Drive-by download attacks

	- A	drive-by-download	attack	infects	your	computer	just	by	visiting	a	page.




		- Malicious	programming	in	the	page	takes	advantage	of	any	vulnerability	in	 your
computer	system,	such	as	in	the	web	browser	or 	operating	system	to	perform
malicious	actions	or	install	other	malware.

			- This	can	happen	without	you	even	noticing.
			- These	pages	could	be	controlled	by	criminals	or	they	might	undermine
legitimate	webpages.

			- Most	webpages	are	okay.


- Typo-squatting

	- Typo-squatting	is	the	deliberate	registration	of	a	domain	name	to	exploit	common	typing
errors	made	by	users	who	type	URLs	into	web	browsers.

	- Simple	and	inexpensive	domain	registration	motivates	speculators	to	register	domain
names	in	bulk	to	profit	from	advertisements	to	redirect	traffic	to	third-party	pages,	deploy
phishing	sites,	or	serve	malware.

	- Very	few	website	owners	protect	themselves	by	registering	their	own	typo-squatting
	domains.

	- Typo-squatters	target	all	websites,	not	just	popular	websites.

	- If the legitimate site is **_example.com:_**

- Man-in-the-Middle	(MITM)	attack

	- In	man-in-the-middle	attacks,	an	attacker	reads	or	alters	Internet	communications	by inserting	themselves	between	you	and	the	intended	receiver	of 	your	communication.
Possible	attacks	and	the	impact	of	this	kind	of	attack	include:


		- Sniffing

			- Sniffing,	or	eavesdropping,	is	the	act	of	reading	traffic	and
collecting	information.

			- Mostly,	sniffing	is	used	to	steal	credentials	that	are	sent	in	plaint	text;
without	encryption.


		- Malware

			- Malware	can	be	installed	in	many	ways,	such	as	redirecting	you	to	a	page	or
directly	exploiting	a	vulnerability.


		- Binary	patching

			- An	attacker	rewrites	part	of	the	code	in	the	executable	file	to	install	malware
or	perform	other	malicious	actions.


		- Cookie inserting/stealing

			- By 	stealing	cookies,	the	attacker	might	be	able	to	copy	the	user’s	session	and
thus	log	in	as	that	user.


		- Cache poisoning

			- A	cache	is	where	a	device	can	temporarily	store	some	data	to	speed	up
future	requests.

			- Cache poisoning happens when an attacker places forged data into the
cache, which might lead to a browser connecting to the wrong IP address
when	visiting	a	site.


		- Fake	certificates

			- Electronic	certificates	are	used	to	verify	the	identity	of 	a	 webpage.	If	attacker
creates	a	fake	certificate	that	is	trusted	by	your	computer,	the	attacker	can
pretend	to	be	any	site	and	listen	in	on	encrypted	connections.


		- Session	hijacking

			- Some protocols work with sessions, which is like a formal conversation where
the	participants	and	time	are	defined.	An	attacker	can	hijack	the	session	and
pretend	to	be	one	of	the	participants.


		- Downgrade attacks

			- This	is	where	the	attacker	interferes	in	the	communication	to	restrict	the	use
of 	newer	(and	safer)	protocols	or	capabilities.


		- Phishing

			- Your	personal	information	can	be	very	valuable	to	thieves.


				- In	particular,	usernames,	passwords,	bank	and	credit	card	details	can benefit	criminals.

					- Because	of	this,	criminals	put	great	effort	into	tricking	people	into	giving	away
their	valuable	information.

					- Generally	these	efforts	are	referred	to	as	phishing;	as	in	phone	fishing	or
fishing	for	personal	information.

			- Phishing	emails	often	appear	to	be	from	an	organization	with	which	you	would	have	stored
some	valuable	information.


				- These	emails	will	often	contain	a	link	taking	you	to	a	page	where	you	can	log-in
or	enter	valuable	information	on	the	pretext	of	checking	something	or	updating
something.

					- View	links	in	email	to	pages	asking	for	personal	information	or	for 	your	to	sign
into	an	account	with	extreme	suspicion.

					- Avoid	clicking	on	any	link	in	an	email	from	a	bank	(or	Microsoft,	Apple,
PayPal...).

				- If 	you	receive	an	email	and	want	to	check	whether	there	is	a	real	issue	with	your
account,	go	to	the	website	in	the	usual	way 	or 	call	the	company.


				- Do	not	click	on	the	email	link,	and	do	not	copy	the	included	URL	into	your	browser.

#### 1.3 In Practice

DO	be	aware	of	different	types	of	threat	so	you	can	spot	potential	dangers	to	your	information	or
your	system.

### 2 What to look for

#### 2.1 In Brief

Browsers	contain	tools	to	help	you	navigate	the	web	safely.	Use	them	consciously	in	combination
with	critical	thinking	for	a	safer	web	experience.

#### 2.2 In Detail


- When	browsing,	remember:


	- Trust	the	icons/cues	that	are	part of the browser itself—NOT	the	ones	within	the	content of the page.



		- A	lock	icon	in	the	URL	line	plus	“http s” 	means	that	communication	with	the
website	is	encrypted.	It	would	be	very	difficult	for	anyone	to	eavesdrop	on	your
data	as	it	travels	from	your	computer	to	the	website.	It	does	 not, however, mean
that	the	website	itself	is	legitimate.	Fake	websites	could	also	have	a	lock	icon.	Your
data	would	be	safe	as	they	travel,	but	then	would	end	up	at	a	malicious	website	at
the	end	point.


		- A	Green	extended	validation	(EV)	certificate	box/green	text	means	that	the	 website
has	gone	through	some	extra	validation	process	to	confirm	that	it	is	legitimate.	It’s
not	a	guarantee,	but	it’s	a	good	cue.
Combined,	the	lock	and	the	green	EV	box	give	some	assurance	that	you	are
visiting	a	legitimate	site	and	that	your	data	are	secure	as	they	travel	to	the	site.

		- All	the	content	of	a	 webpage	can	be	faked.

			- Attackers	can	make	exact	copies	of	legitimate	websites	so	that	the	fake	ones	look
“professional.”	They	also	make	themselves	look	trustworthy	by 	adding	fake	“seals.”

				- Do	not	rely	only	on	the	webpage	content	to	determine	legitimacy.	Use	the
browser	cues.

		- Type	in	URLs	yourself	for 	known	websites	rather	than	trusting	links.

		- Look	for	the	browser	cues	before	entering	personal	or 	financial	details	like	your	credit	card number	or 	password.

			- If 	the	browser	warns	you	against	visiting	a	page...	take	it	seriously.	Double-check
the	URL,	make	sure	you	have	the	right	location.


- Identifying	the	security	features	of	your	browser

	- Internet	Explorer


		- The	phishing	filter	can	help	protect	you	from	phishing	attacks,	online	fraud	and fake	websites.


-  Internet Explorer address bar with phishing warning ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_01.png "Image_title")





	- Protected	mode	can	help	protect	your	computer	from	websites	that	try	to	install malicious	software	or	to	save	files	on	your	computer	without	your	consent.


- Image : ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_02.png "Image_title")

- _Image tag : Protected Mode status indicator_



	- Protected	Mode	status	indicator




		- Higher	security	levels	can	help	protect	you	from	hackers	and
web	attacks.

		- The	security	status	bar	displays	the	identity	of 	secure	websites	to	help
you	make	informed	decisions	when	using	online	banking	or	merchants.
Internet	Explorer	now	supports	Extended	Validation	(EV)	certificates	to
help	make	a	more	positive	identification	of	website	owners
and	organizations.

- Image : ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_03.png "Image_title")

- _Image tag : Security Status Bar (right side of address bar)_



	- Internet	Explorer	security	status	bar	(right	side	of	address	bar)


		- When	you	visit	a	website	that	uses	a	secure	connection,	the	colour
of 	the	security	status	bar	tells	you	whether	the	security	certificate
is	 valid	or	not.	It	displays	the	level	of 	validation	done	by	the
certifying	organization.

- The	following	table	describes	what	the	security	status	bar	colours	mean.


Colour What it means



Colour|What it means
-----|:------
Red | The	certificate	is	out-of-date,	not	valid	or	has	an	error.
Yellow | The	authenticity	of 	the	certificate	or	certification	authority	that issued	it	cannot	be	verified.	This	might	indicate	a	problem	with the	certification	authority's	website.
White| The	certificate	has	normal	validation.	This	means	that communication between	your	browser	and	the	website	is encrypted.	The	certification	authority	makes	no	assertion	about the	business	practices	of	the	website.
Green | The	certificate	uses	extended	validation.	This	means	that communication	between	your	browser	and	website	is encrypted,	and	that	the	certification	authority	has	confirmed the	 website	is	owned	or	operated	by	a	business	that	is	legally organized	under	the	jurisdiction	shown	in	the	certificate	and on	the	security	status	bar.	The	certification	authority	makes	no assertion	about	the	business	practices	of	the	website [Note 1](#note-1) [Note 2](#note-2)


- Safari


	- When	you	connect	to	a	website	with	an	encrypted	connection	in	Safari,	you	will	 see	a	green	lock	icon	in	the	toolbar	next	to	the	name	of	the	company	you	have connected	to	(e.g.;	Apple	Inc.).

		- If 	you	click	the	lock	icon,	you	will	see	a	dialog	box	saying	that	“Safari	is	using an	encrypted	connection	to	www.icloud.com.”	This	tells	you	the	connection is	secure.


 - Image : ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_04.png "Image_title")


 - _Image tag : Connected to a legitimate site on Safari_


	- If 	you	connect	to	a	website	that	isn’t	secure,	you	will	see	a	message that	says	“Safari	can’t	verify	the	identity	of 	the	website.”	If 	you	see	this message,	do	not	proceed	or	attempt	to	sign	in[Note 3](#note-3).


	- Image : ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_05.png "Image_title")

	- _Image tag : An unverified site on Safari_




- Chrome


	 - One	of	the	most	important	security	indicators	in	Google	Chrome	is	where	you
enter	web	addresses;	called	the	“omnibox”	because	it	will	take	either	a	search
or	a	 webpage	address.

 	- Image : ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_06.png "Image_title")


	- Image tag : The 'omnibox' in Chrome


		- The	first	thing	to	notice	is	the	domain	name	of	the	website.	The	domain	name indicates	which	website	is	being	displayed	in	the	current	tab.	Google	Chrome highlights	it	in	a	slightly	darker	colour.	For	example,	the	domain	name	in	the image	above	is	“www.google.com.”


			- Check	that	the	omnibox	has	highlighted	the	domain	name	you	expect.	If the	domain	name	doesn’t	match	what	you	expect,	the	website	might be	fake.


		- The second thing to notice is the lock icon, which is displayed to the left of
 the	 website	address	and,	in	the	case	above,	coloured	green.


			- This	space	will	display	the	status	of	the	connection	and	the	page certificate.	It	can	display	any	of 	the	following:


	 			- Green	lock	icon ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_07.png)

					- The	site's	certificate	is	valid,	and	its	identity	has	been	verified by 	a	trusted	third-party.	Google	Chrome	has	established	a secure	connection	with	the	site	you're	viewing.


	 			- Orange	exclamation	icon ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_08.png)

					- The	site	has	not	provided	the	browser	with	a	certificate.	This	is
normal	for 	regular	HTTP	sites	because	certificates	are	usually
provided	only	if 	the	site	uses	encryption.


	 			- Webpage icon ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_09.png)

					- Your	connection	to	the	site	is	not	encrypted.	This	is	normal	for
regular	http	sites.


	 			- Lock	icon	with	yellow	warning	triangle ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_10.png)


					- Google	Chrome	can	see	the	site’s	certificate	and	your
connection	to	the	site	is	encrypted	but	the	site	uses	a	weak
security	setup	or	something	unwanted	on	the	page,	so	your
connection	might	not	be	private.

					- These	are	common	mistakes	in	website	configurations.

					- Seeing	this	icon	doesn't	guarantee	that	your	connection	is
secure.	Proceed	with	caution	and	do	not	enter	private	or
personal	information	on	this	page.




	 			- Red	lock	icon ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_11.png)

					- There	are	problems	with	the	site's	certificate	or	mixed	scripting.

					- Mixed	scripting	is	when	a	page	contains	a	mixture	of	encrypted
and	unencrypted	content.	It	can	be	hard	to	know	if 	using	the
page	is	safe	or	not.	Proceed	with	caution[Note 4](#note-4).



			- Extended	validation	(EV)	certificate	(see	green	box	over	the	lock	icon  and	the	web	address	in	the	image	below).


- Image : ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_12.png "Image_title")



- Image tag : An Extended validation Certificate from PayPal

	- The	EV	certificate	helps	the	browser	determine the name of	the organization	that	runs	the	web	site.
	- The	extended	validation	indicator	helps you determine
which	organization	is	responsible	for	the displayed webpage. For 	example,	the	extended	validation indicator for https://www.benefitaccess.com/	says	“Citigroup	Inc.	[US][Note 5](#note-5).




#### 2.3 In Practice

DO	look	closely	at	the	address	bar	to	identify	signs	of	security.

DO	be	careful	to	make	sure	you	connect	to	the	correct	site.

### 3	 Configuring	the	browser

#### 3.1 In Brief

Dangerous	websites	are	written	with	the	same	tools	as	legitimate	websites,	so	it	isn’t	possible	to
turn	off	just	the	unsafe	tools.	Learn	what	these	tools	are	and	how	to	make	choices	about	what	to
allow	in	 your	browser.

#### 3.2 In Detail


- Dangerous	websites	are	written	with	the	same	programming	tools	as	legitimate	websites.They
are	an	easy	way 	to	stay	in	touch	with	friends,	family	and	acquaintances.

	- There	are	no	bad	tools,	just	bad	programmers.
	- It	isn’t	possible	to	turn	off	the	dangerous	tools	without	consequence.
	- Turning	tools	off	can	affect	the	operation	of	different	websites	in	different	ways




		- Cookies

			- A	webpage	sometimes	stores	information	in	your	browser;	these	pieces	of
information	are	called	cookies.




				- This	might	be	so	that	the	page	can	remember	who	you	are	and	your
preferences.	Often,	it	is	to	make	a	page	more	convenient	for	you.

			- Cookies	allow	the	page	to	gather	very	precise	information	about	how	you	use
that	page.

			- You	can	delete	cookies.	You	can	also	block	cookies	using	different	levels of 	aggressiveness.

				- Blocking	cookies	can	cause	some	websites	to	not	function	properly
because	they	are	designed	assuming	that	you	will	allow	cookies.

			- Sophisticated	technologies	allow	companies	to	track	your	online	activities
without	using	cookies.


				- There is no easy and reliable manner to avoid tracking by these technologies.	These	methods	mean	that	even	if	you	block	cookies	you are	not	assured	of	privacy.

			- Be	aware	of	cookies,	and	that	they	are	not	the	only	tracking	technology.




		- Blocking	Cookies

			- Google	Chrome


				- Select	the	Chrome	menu icon ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_13.png).

				- Select _**Settings**_.

				- Near	the	bottom	of	the	page,	select	 _**Show advanced settings**_.



				- In the "Privacy" section, select _**Content settings**_.



				- Select _**Block sites from setting any data**_.


				- Select _**Done**_ [Note 6](#note-6).



				- You	can	also	remove	cookies [Note 7](#note-7).



			- Internet	Explorer



				- Open	Internet	Explorer	by 	clicking	the	 _**Start button**_ ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_14.png).
In the search box,	type	 _**Internet Explorer**_, 	and	then,	in	the	list	of	results,	click	 _**Internet Explorer**_.



				- Click the _**Tools button**_ ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_15.png),
point to _**Safety**_, and then click _**Delete browsing history**_.



				- Select	the	Cookies	check	box,	and	then	click	Delete [Note 8](#note-8).







			- Safari


				- Choose _**Safari > Preferences**_, click __Privacy__, then	do	any	of 	the	following:

					- Change	which	cookies	and	website	data are accepted. Select	a “Cookies	and	website	data”	option :

						- Always	block:	Never	store	cookies.


						- Allow	from	current	website	only:	Safari	accepts	cookies	and
website	data	only	from	the	website	you	are	currently	visiting.
Websites	often	have	embedded	content	from	other	sources.
Safari does not allow these third-parties to store or access
cookies	or	other	data.


						- Allow	from	websites	I	visit:	Safari	accepts	cookies	and	website
data	only	from	websites	you	visit.	Safari	uses	your	existing
cookies	to	determine	whether	you	have	visited	a	website
before.	Selecting	this	option	helps	prevent	websites	that	have
embedded	content	in	other	websites	you	browse	from	storing
cookies	and	data	on	your	Mac.


			- IOS	(iPhone,	iPad)




				- _**Settings > Safari > Block Cookies**_ 	and	choose	one	of	the	following:

				- Always	Block;


				- Allow	from	Current	Websites	Only;

				- Allow	from	Websites	I	Visit;	or


				- Always	Allow [Note 9](#note-9).





			- Android


				- Open	the	Chrome	app ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_16.png);

				- Touch	the	menu ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_17.png);

				- Touch	 _**Site settings**_;




				- Uncheck _**Cookies**_ 	to	prevent	webpages	from	storing	cookies	on	your mobile	device.




		- JavaScript

			- JavaScript	provides	additional	tools	for	developers	writing	webpages.	It	can also	assist	developers	of	malware.

			- Turning	off	JavaScript	will	make	your	browser	more	secure	but	it	can	also cause	some	webpages	to	not	function	properly



				- Turning	off	Java	script	is	an	extreme	measure,	and	best	only	done temporarily if the risk associated with doing something is considered to
be	 very	high.

			- Google	Chrome


				- Select	the	Chrome	menu	icon ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_18.png).


				- Select _**Settings**_.


				- Near	the	bottom	of	the	page,	select	 _**Show advanced settings**_.


				- In the "Privacy" section, select _**Content settings**_.

				- In	the	“JavaScript”	Section	Select	 _**“Do not allow any site to run JavaScript”**_.


				- Select _**Done**_.

			- Internet	Explorer




				- On	the	web	browser	menu,	click	 _**Tools**_ 	or	the	Tools	icon	(which	looks	like a	gear),	and	select	 _**Internet Options**_.


				- When the _**“Internet Options"**_ window opens, select the _**Security**_ tab.



				- On the _**Security**_ 	tab,	make	sure	the	Internet	zone	is	selected,	and	then
click on the _**Custom level button**_.


				- In	the	Security	Settings	–	Internet	Zone	dialog	box,	click	 _**Disable for
Active Scripting**_ 	in	the	Scripting	section.



				- When	the	"Warning!"	window	opens	and	asks,	"Are	you	sure	you	want	to change	the	settings	for	this	zone?"	select	 _**Yes**_.


				- Click _**OK**_ at the bottom of the Internet Options window to close the dialog	box [Note 10](#note-10).





			- Apple Safari



				- While in Safari Click the _**Safari Menu >Preferences**_. 	In	the	Security	panel
uncheck	the	box	marked	 _**“Enable JavaScript**_.”




		- Java

			- Java	is	not	the	same	thing	as	JavaScript.	Java	helps	translate	Java	programs for 	your	computer.




				- This	is	helpful	for 	programmers	as	they	only	have	to	write	the	program
once	without	translating	it	for	different	types	of	computers.




				- It	is	also	very	helpful	for 	people	writing	malware.


			- Java	is	not	necessary	for 	most	of	what	you	do	with	your	computer,	so	it	should be	disabled.




			- You	may	not	have	Java	on	your	computer.	However,	if	you	do,	turning	it	off	will	 be	a	two-step	process.




				- Step	1	(Find	the	Java	Settings	Control)


	 				- Windows

						- Launch	the	 **_Windows Start_** 	menu;
						- Click on **_Programs;_**
						- Find	the	 **_Java_** 	program	listing;
						- Click **_Configure Java_** 	to	launch	the	Java	Control	Panel.


					- Windows	(alternative	method	for	older	versions)

						- Use	search	to	find	the	Control	Panel;
						- Press **_Windows logo key + W_** to open the **_Search charm_** to search	settings;

						OR

						- Drag	the	Mouse	pointer	to	the	bottom-right	corner	of 	the
screen, then click on the Search 	icon;

						- In	the	search	box	enter **_Java Control Panel;_**
						- Click	on	Java	icon	to	open	the	Java	Control	Panel.


					- Mac OS

						- Click	on	Apple	icon	on	upper	left	of	screen;
						- Go	to	 **_System Preferences_** ;
						- Click	on	the	Java	icon	to	access	the	Java	Control	Panel [Note 11](#note-11).






				- Step	2	(Turn	off	Java	–	the	same	for	Windows	and	Mac	OSs)


	 				- In the _**Java Control Panel**_, click on the Security 	tab;


					- Deselect	the	check	box	for _**Enable Java content**_ in the browser
This	will	disable	the	Java	plug-in	in	the	browser;

					- Click _**Apply**_. When	the	Windows	User	Account	Control	(UAC)
dialog	appears,	allow	permissions	to	make	the	changes;


					- Click _**OK**_ 	in	the	Java	Plug-in	confirmation	window;


					- _**Restart the browser**_ 	for	changes	to	take	effect.




		- Privacy mode

			- Many	browsers	offer	a	privacy	mode	designed	to	offer	some	privacy	to	users who	share	computers.

				- The	browser	will	not	keep	the	history	for 	the	session.

				- This	is	not	perfect	privacy.	You	will	not	be	anonymous	while	in this	session.

				- The	privacy	offered	by	this	mode	is	only	local,	and	does	little	to	mask
your	identity	to	the	world.

			- Opening	a	window	in	privacy	mode	is	generally	done	by	clicking	the	file	menu and	selecting	a	new	private	window.

This	is	called	something	different	in	each	browser,	and	there	are	variations	on	how	to	open	a window.	The	Shortcut	keys	to	open	a	new	window	or 	tab	are	quite	consistent.	On	windows	press the	‘Ctrl’	Key,	on	an	Apple	Computer	use	the	Command	‘⌘’	key 	instead.




Browser|Privacy Mode Name|Shortcut Key
-----|:------|:------
Safari|New	Private	Window | Ctrl	(⌘)	+	Shift	+	N
Chrome |New	Incognito	Window| Ctrl	(⌘)	+	Shift	+	N
Firefox|New	Private	Window| Ctrl	(⌘)	+	Shift	+	P
Internet	Explorer| InPrivate	Browsing| Ctrl	(⌘)	+	Shift	+	P





- Ad blockers
	- Ad blockers can be added to browsers to block the advertising content in pages.
		- This	can	help	security	because	some	advertising	can	be	used	to distribute	malware.
		- These	are	third-party	applications.	We	do	not	recommend	any	particular application	but	do	recommend	that	you	buy	from	official	vendors.
		- Examples	and	information	can	be	found at:
			- [GetAdBlock](https://getadblock.com)
			- [AdBlockPlus](https://adblockplus.org) [Note 12](#note-12)



	- Flash

		- Flash	allows	interactive	content.	It	was	developed	in	the	late	90s,	and	has been	very	popular	because	it	has	many	powerful	tools.

		- Newer,	better	tools	have	been	developed.
		- Flash	is	used	less	and	less.	It	has	been	abused	to	install	malware.


			- Chrome

				- _**Type**_ 	chrome://plugins/	into	Google	Chrome’s	location	bar	and press	Enter.	Click	the	 _**“Disable”**_ 	link	under	the	Adobe	Flash	Player plug-in.


			- Internet	Explorer


				- Click	the	gear	menu,	and	select	 _**Manage add-ons**_. Click the Show box	and	select	 _**All add-ons**_. 	Locate	 _**Shockwave Flash Object**_ 	under _**Microsoft Windows Third-Party Application Component**_, select it, and click the _**Disable button**_.


			- Microsoft Edge


				- _**Click the menu button**_ in Edge and select _**Settings**_. Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings panel and click _**“View advanced settings”**_. 	Set	the	“Use	Adobe	Flash	Player”	slider	to	 _**“Off”**_.

			- Apple Safari


				- Click the _**Safari Menu >Preferences**_. 	In	the	 _**Security**_	panel,	click Security. Then click the _**Plug-in Settings button**_. 	In	the	next	panel, with	Adobe	Flash	selected	at	the	left,	select	 _**Block**_ 	from	the	menu
at	lower	right	of	the	screen	(immediately	above	the	Done	button).
Click _**Done**_ 	and	exit	the	settings	menu [Note 13](#note-13).



#### 3.3 In Practice

DO	disable	Java	and	make	an	informed	choice	about	Cookies,	JavaScript,	advertising	blocking and	Flash.

DO	use	the	privacy	mode	to	browse	discreetly.

### 4 Putting it into practice

#### 4.1 In Brief

Put	 what	you	have	learned	into	practice.	Remember	to	take	care	with	the	webpage	address,	look

for 	security	indicators,	and	warning	messages	when	using	an	Internet	browser.

#### 4.2 In Detail


- The	following	is	an	example	of	navigating	to	a	page	and	identifying	a	potentially
dangerous	website.

	- Typing	in	the	URL

		- Go	to	 _**“outlook.com”**_, 	type	carefully	and	check	before	pressing	 _**Enter**_.

		- :skull: **_BEWARE of “uotlook.com.” It redirects to a potentially dangerous page._** :skull:

		- **_Look for IP addresses_** 	in	the	URL	(numbers	only)	or	addresses	similar	to	the one	you	want	but	not	quite.


		- Also	 **_look for misspelled domain names_** 	and	subtle	substitutions	such	as	0	for O	or	vv	for 	w.

	- _Assessing the page_  ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_19.png "Image_title")



		- A	number	of 	clues	on	this	page	show	that	it	is	dangerous.	Two	are	very	clear indicators	(1 & 2).	Two	are	less	clear	(3 & 4)	but	add	to	the	assessment.

			_1_:	 There	is	no	lock	icon	or	green	in	the	address	box.	This	tells	us	that	the	page	is not	using	a	secure	connection	and	that	there	is	no	certificate.	We	expect	that our	outlook.com	page	would	have	both.

			_2_:	 The	domain	name	is	not	a	Microsoft	name.	“native-adventure.com”	is	not	a
name	that	we	 would	expect	to	see.	This	indicates	that	this	page	is	probably	a fake	used	for	phishing.

			_3_:	 Threatening	language.	It	is	not	normal	for 	a	legitimate	business	to	threaten their	customers	with	account	deactivation.

			_4_:	 Poor	grammar.	A	major	corporation	like	Microsoft	is	unlikely	to	publish	a	page with	poor	grammar.


		- Some	indicators	on	this	page	provide	clues	that	the	page	is	legitimate:

		- Image : ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_20.png "Image_title")
			_1_:	 A	green	lock	symbol.	This	indicates	a	secure	connection.
			_2_:	 A	certificate	belonging	to	the	organization	you	would	expect	to	own
this	website.

			_3_:	 The	domain	name	is	a	bit	odd.	However,	the	green	box	showing	ownership
provides	reassurance.	(Live.com	is	a	brand	used	to	unify	a	number
of 	Microsoft	services	to	assist	with	living;	such	as	Hotmail,	outlook,	and
MSN	Messenger).
			_4_: 	Note,	the	lack	of	grammar	errors	or	threatening	language.

		- Image : ![alt text](/images/EN_Going_out_onto_the_Internet_21.png "Image_title")




		- A	page	like	this	is	a	clear	warning	that	the	page	is	dangerous.	This	page	is	shown
when	the	browser	has	identified	the	page	as	a	problem.	Press	the	Back	button	and
avoid	the	website.




		- If 	you	think	you	have	made	a	mistake,	change	your	passwords	immediately.

			- If 	the	account	was	for	a	bank,	check	your	statements	and	contact	your provider	if 	there	is	an	issue.




		- If 	you	think	you	or	someone	you	know	has	been	a	victim	of	fraud,	please	contact the	Canadian	Anti-Fraud	Centre	at: _**1-888-495-8501**_	or	report	online	at	[Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre](http://www.antifraudcentre.ca).

#### 4.3 In Practice

DO	take	care	with	the	web	address,	look	for	security	indicators	and	heed	warning	messages.
