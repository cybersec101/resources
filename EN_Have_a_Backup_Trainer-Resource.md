- Ability to restore from backup


## Background and Detail for Trainer

### 1 The importance of backing up

#### 1.1 In Brief

Backups are important. Copy (back up) your data frequently in case something happens to
the original.

#### 1.2 In Detail
<!-- Backing up is explained as a seperate process from archiving. Archiving is a harm minimization option removing data from the active network to limit accessability to that information by physical means.  The 3,2,1 rule for backups that is used by many businesses here (3 backups, 2 in rotation, 1 offsite) is considered as a complex option that might make backing up appear complex and expensive. This guide is primarily for those that have no backups.  The cloud option is introduced as a potential 'offsite'.  Note that a process of taking a backup disk out of rotation then purging files on active media is a valid method of archiving.  --!>

- There are two processes, archiving and backing up. Archiving moves a file to storage, backing
up makes a copy of a file.  	

-	The processes are more important than the storage medium. Ideally you will have a drive for
back up and a drive for archive; they could be the same type of drive.

-	A backup is a __copy__ of the information stored on your computer, tablet or phone.

 	- Make backups to avoid losing information in case something happens to your devices.
 	- It is like photocopying important documents in case you lose the originals.
 	- It is a very regular process, so you can have  many copies.
 	- There is software to manage this for you.

- Archiving is __moving__ a file to a safe place, the file won’t be on the computer anymore.
	 - Archiving is like filing a document in a filing cabinet.
 	- The document isn’t on your desk any more and is safe from prying eyes.
 	- If you want the document you will have to retrieve it.
 	- This is an occasional process, often done manually (copy and delete).

- Backing up data on a computer is becoming more and more important because people often
don’t have other copies of their information.
 	- Photos, music and documents are on our computers—and nowhere else.
 	- Having only one single copy of important files is very risky.
		- The devices within the computer that store the information wear out with use and
time. Eventually, they will fail.
		- The software that stores and retrieves the data may also fail.
 	- Perhaps the biggest risk to your information is from software created with malicious intentions (malware).
		- Malware affects how the computer functions and could lead to a loss of data.
		- Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents access to stored information or the computer from responding to commands. It then demands payment to restore normal access.
	- Backing up your information regularly solves many problems, and can save time, money
and heartache in the event of a computer problem.

#### 1.3 In Practice

DO back up your computer and data frequently.

### 2 The importance of archiving

#### 2.1 In Brief

Archiving (_moving_ files to a storage unit not connected to the computer system and deleting
them from your computer) makes more space on your computer and reduces the risk of data loss
and theft.

#### 2.2 In Detail

- Choose what to archive.

 - Prioritize unique and high-value files over those that exist elsewhere or are less important.

		- The decreasing cost of storage media means that, for home use, you probably
have room to archive everything.
		- If information is not used very often, it can be advantageous to archive it.

			 This will:

			- Free up system disk space in your computer for information you use more
    often (delete the data from your computer to free up this space);
			- Reduce the size of the backup;
			- Reduce the amount of personal information at risk from malware. (Information in an archive is not directly accessible to hackers so it will not be lost or exposed if the computer is compromised); and
			- Reduce the damage from a complete failure. It is possible to lose both a
    computer and its backup at the same time.

- Archiving keeps your data safe from prying eyes.

	- A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that gives an intruder access to a computer over the Internet without the knowledge of its owner.

	- The intruder can have access to files, see what is happening on the screen and
even access the computer’s microphone, camera and speaker.
	- Files that are archived will not be accessible to such malware.

- Archiving protects you against the impact of Ransomware.

	- Ransomware is a type of malware that locks your data and demands that you pay a ransom before a key is given to unlock it. Some ransomware will lock backups as well. An archive provides an alternative to paying or losing all of your data.

#### 2.3 In Practice

DO take the time to archive frequently.

### 3 Selecting backup media

#### 3.1 In Brief

A hard disk drive is generally the best option for home backups. Mobile devices can be backed
up to the cloud or through a home computer.

#### 3.2 In Detail

- At home, you can do backups with an external hard disk drive.

	- A hard disk provides a substantial amount of storage for a reasonable cost.
	- The large amount of data on home computers has made the use of a hard disk drive the
    most appropriate option.
	- Hard disk drives allow for a large number of reliable rewrites compared with other types
    of media.
	- Hard disk drives can be connected to the computer directly through an external port or
    indirectly over a Wi-Fi connection.
	- When buying a hard disk drive, consider the following criteria:
 		- _Speed_ is not a concern, as you will not be interacting with the files on the drive on
a regular basis.
 		- The _capacity_ of the disk and the _reliability_ of the drive are more important.
			- Reliability is not guaranteed on consumer grade disks; however, you should stick to well-established manufactures such as Western Digital or Seagate that offer warranties.
			- Choose a drive that has twice the capacity of the drive in your computer. If your computer disk is 256 Gb, a 500 Gb external disk is a good solution. This will allow the backup drive to hold:
				- A full copy of the contents of your computer; and
				- Many system “snapshots” to counteract data loss and system failures.
		- An external hard disk drive will connect (plug in) to the computer at an external port.
 			- Check which ports your computer has before shopping (they are at the side of
    a laptop or at the back of a desktop computer).
    			- A USB drive is the best option for most computers.
				- A USB port on your computer will often be marked with this symbol:
				- I  ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_01.png "USB Symbol")
				- USB ports are rectangular and are a little over a centimeter:
(about ½ inch) wide.
					-  USB 3.0 Ports ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_02.png)
					-  USB 2.0 Ports ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_03.png)
					-  Thunderbolt & USB 3.0 Ports![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_04.png)
				- The standard of USB is not of great importance either. A USB 3.0 disk
will provide faster data transfer when connected to a USB 3.0 port,
but the difference in speed will not make a practical difference to the
operation of a backup.

				- You may use a Thunderbolt connection for a Mac computer.
					- Drives using Thunderbolt connections are generally more
    expensive and the difference in connection speed is no
    real advantage.


- You can back up your information to a cloud service.

	- A cloud service provides storage space on a server in another location on the Internet.
	- Drop Box, Google Drive and Apple iCloud are a few examples of Cloud Service Providers.
    Other examples can be found in the Consumer Report[Note 1](#note-1) below.




		- Often the physical location of a service is not particularly important.

			- If something happens to your equipment (like a flood or a fire), the copy on
    the cloud is safe.
			- Your data may be stored in other countries and be managed by an external
    company and its employees. This might be a risk.

		- Although reputable companies place importance on the security of your data, it is possible that
someone accesses the data.

			- Set up good passwords and authentication for a cloud service backup.


	- Cloud services are useful for mobile devices.

		- They provide a frequently updated copy of the information on the device because
they don’t rely on connecting to a particular machine or network.
		- Mobile devices can also be backed up to a computer where configured to do so.

			- The management app for syncing the phone with the computer will provide
    the option to back up the device as well.

- Choosing a backup medium depends on how you use the device or computer.

	- If it is generally in the home or very regularly in the home, a backup to a disk is a good
    option for most situations.
	- If the device is out of the home for long periods of time, then a cloud service could be more
    appropriate, because the backup can happen wirelessly.
	- If you have highly sensitive data on the device, a backup to a hard disk drive is a better
    option than the cloud. Keep in mind that if the backup disk is in the same physical location
    as the computer, harm (e.g., fire, flood, theft) could happen to both simultaneously, leaving
    you with no copies.

#### 3.3 In Practice

DO select a backup medium that is appropriate for your device and its use.

### 4 Prepare a backup plan

#### 4.1 In Brief

A frequent, automatic backup, combined with a less regular manual archive is a safe plan.

#### 4.2 In Detail

- Creating backups should prepare you for two types of problems:

	 - Loss or alteration of files on an operating computer.

		- This could be the accidental deletion of a file, a change in configuration or the
introduction of malware to the system.
		- This kind of problem might be immediately apparent or take some time before
becoming noticeable.
		- A regular backup (e.g. every hour) is the best solution as it records the working
state of the system very frequently.

			- These can be set up to operate automatically. It is best to have them happen
    as frequently as is practical.
			- These are known as ‘incremental backups’ as they usually only store the
    changes made since the last backup.



	- Application (program) failures.

		- These happen through corrupt updates or the introduction of malware to the
system that might go unnoticed for a time but can affect the whole system.
		- A backup can take the system back to a previous state.


-	Keeping a series of backups that represent the functioning system state at various dates will
allow you to restore the system to the date you want.

-	Keeping a separate system of archives provides alternative solutions in case system failures
affect the entire system including connected backup systems.

	- These are generally less regular backups, often performed manually.

-	Therefore, you normally need two external hard disks.

	- An incremental backup that happens often and stores multiple points for restoration; and

	- An offline archive that is performed periodically and is not connected to the machine
    constantly (to avoid getting corrupted).

-	A formal written plan for these backups includes:

	- A regular (perhaps monthly) time to check that a backup is turned on and has made a
    recent copy of the data on the disk;
	- A less regular time (perhaps once a season, biannually or annually) to manually move data
    to an archive.

#### 4.3 In Practice

DO have a plan for backing up. Making a formal (written) plan is a good idea.

### 5	 Configuring	automatic	backups

#### 5.1 In Brief

Automatic backups run by themselves frequently and keep a very recent copy of your files.
Windows and Apple computers both include a feature for automatic backups.

#### 5.2 In Detail

-	The backup systems on Windows and Apple computers are different.

	- Apple computers have a combined backup and restore system called Time Machine.

 		- Apple

			- If Time Machine doesn't ask you to choose a backup disk:




 				- Open **_Time Machine_** preferences from the **_Time Machine menu_**  ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_05.png) in the menu bar. Or choose **_Apple menu > System Preferences,_** then click **_Time Machine._**

				- Click **_Select Backup Disk._**

				- Select an external hard drive, **_Time Capsule,_** or other storage solution
from the list, then click **_Use Disk._**

				- After you choose a backup disk, optionally click **_Add_** or **_Remove Backup Disk_** to add more backup disks for extra security and convenience.   

				- ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_06.png "Apple Time Machine Preferences")




			- Image Back up using Time Machine

				- After you set up Time Machine, it automatically makes hourly backups
of the past 24 hours, daily backups for the past month, and weekly
backups for all previous months. The oldest backups are deleted when
your backup drive is full.

				- To back up now instead of waiting for the next automatic backup,
choose **_Back Up Now_** from the Time Machine menu.

				- To stop automatic backups, **_turn off_** Time Machine in **_Time Machine
preferences._** You can still back up manually by choosing **_Back Up Now_**
from the **_Time Machine menu._**

				- To pause a backup, choose **_Stop Backup_** from the Time Machine menu.
To resume, choose **_Back Up Now._**

				- To check the status of a backup, use the **_Time Machine menu._**
The icon shows when Time Machine is backing up ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_07.png) , whether it is idle
until the next automatic backup ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_08.png) , or unable to complete the backup.

- To exclude items from your backup, open **_Time Machine preferences_**
from the Time machine menu, click **_Options,_** then click **_Add_** ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_09.png)
and select the item to exclude.  

- ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_10.png "Apple time Machine Preferences)




	- Your first backup may take a long time, depending on how many files
    you have.
	- You can continue using your Mac while a backup is under way.
	- Some Mac computers make backups even when asleep.
	- Time Machine backs up only the files that changed since the previous backup, so future backups will be faster [Note 2](#note-2) [Note 3](#note-3).




- Windows computers have a function called File History and a separate function for
system recovery.

	- These are configured separately. Unfortunately all the versions of Windows
    are configured slightly differently. Windows 7 computers call File History ‘Backup’.

		- Windows 10

 			- Set up your backup.

				- Select the Start button  ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_11.png), then select **_Settings > Update &_**
    **_Security > Backup > Add a drive_** , and choose an external drive or
    network location for your backups.

				- Every hour, Windows backs up everything in your user folder
    (C:\Users\username). To change which files get backed up or how
    often backups happen, go to More options [Note 4](#note-4).



				- File History only backs up files in the Documents, Music, Pictures,
    Videos and Desktop folders and the OneDrive files available
    offline on your PC. If you want files or folders located elsewhere to
    be backed up, add them to one of these folders.

			- To set up a drive for File History:

				- If you are going to use a new external drive, connect it to your PC.

				- If you see a notification asking if you want to configure the drive
    for **_File History_** , tap or click it, and then **_turn on File History_** on the
    screen that appears.

				- Otherwise, follow these steps to choose either a network drive or
    an external drive that’s already connected to your PC.



				- Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, then tap **_Search_**
    (If you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the
    screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click **_Search_** ).

				- Enter **_File History settings_** in the search box, then tap or click
    **_File History settings._**

				- Tap or click **_Select a drive,_** and choose the network or external
    drive you want to use.

				- Turn on **_File History._** [Note 5](#note-5).

				- ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_12.png "Windows Backup Preference")





		- Windows 7

			- To create a new, full backup:

				- After you create your first backup, Windows Backup will add new
    or changed information to your subsequent backups.

				- If you are saving your backups on a hard drive or network
    location, Windows Backup will create a new, full backup for you
    automatically when needed.

				- If you are saving your backups on CDs or DVDs and can't find an
    existing backup disc, or if you want to create a new backup of all
    of the files on your computer, you can create a full backup.


			- To create a full backup:

				- Open Backup and Restore by clicking the **_Start_** button ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_13.png) ,
    clicking **_Control Panel,_** clicking **_System and Maintenance,_** and then
    clicking **_Backup and Restore._**

				- In the left pane, click **_Create new, full backup._**


			- To back up your files:


				- Open Backup and Restore by clicking the **_Start_** button ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_14.png) ,
    clicking **_Control Panel,_** clicking **_System and Maintenance,_** and then
    clicking **_Backup and Restore._**




				- Do one of the following:

   					- If you've never used Windows Backup before, click **_Set up_**
       **_backup,_** then follow the steps in the wizard ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_15.png). If you are
       prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type
       the password or provide confirmation.

					- If you've created a backup before, you can wait for your
       regularly scheduled backup or manually create a new backup
       by clicking **_Back up now_** ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_16.png). If you are prompted for an
       administrator password or confirmation, type the password or
       provide confirmation [Note 6](#note-6).



#### 5.3 In Practice

DO set up regular automatic backups.

### 6	 Retrieving	a	file	from	backup

#### 6.1 In Brief

You can restore a single file or the complete system from your backup.

#### 6.2 In Detail

-	Apple

	- Restore from a Time Machine backup:

		- Restore specific files:

		- Choose from the Time Machine menu ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_17.png) , or click **_Enter Time Machine_** in the Dock.
 Find the files to restore:

			- Use the timeline on the edge of the screen to see the files in your Time
    Machine backup as they were at that date and time. The timeline may also
    include local snapshots.

			- Use the onscreen up and down arrows to jump to the last time the contents
    of the window changed. You can also use the search field in a window to find
    a file, then move through time while focused on changes to that file.

			- Select a file and press the space bar to preview the file and make sure it is
    the one you want.

				- Click **_Restore_** to restore the selected file or Control-click the file for
other options [Note 7](#note-7).




	- Recover an Apple system by holding down the command and R keys at start up with the backup drive connected [Note 8](#note-8).

	- ![Image Missing](/images/EN_Have_a_Backup_18.png "Recovery Screen on Apple Computer")



-	Windows 10

	- To restore files or folders:

		- Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap **_Search_** (or if you are using a mouse,
point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and
then click **_Search_** ), enter “restore your files” in the search box, and then tap or click
Restore your files with File History.

		- Enter the name of file you're looking for in the search box, or use the left and right
arrows to browse through different versions of your folders and files.

		- Select what you want to restore to its original location, and then tap or click the
**_Restore_** button. If you want to restore your files to a different location than the
original, press and hold or right-click the **_Restore_** button, tap or click **_Restore To,_**
and then choose a new location [Note 9](#note-9).




	- To restore your PC to an earlier point in time:

		- Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, then tap **_Search_** (If you are using a
mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer
down, and then click **_Search_** ).

		- Enter Control Panel in the search box, and tap or click **_Control Panel._**
 Enter Recovery in the Control Panel search box, and then tap or click **_Recovery._**

		- Tap or click **_Open System Restore,_** and then follow the instructions [Note 10](#note-10).



#### 6.3 In Practice

DO know how to restore files from your backup.
